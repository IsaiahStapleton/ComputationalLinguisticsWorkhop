       "\"[ The Tragedie of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare 1599 ] Actus Primus . Scoena Prima . Enter Flauius , Murellus , and certaine Commoners ouer the Stage . Flauius . Hence : home you idle Creatures , get you home : Is this a Holiday ? What , know you not ( Being Mechanicall ) you ought not walke Vpon a labouring day , without the signe Of your Profession ? Speake , what Trade art thou ? Car . Why Sir , a Carpenter Mur . Where is thy Leather Apron , and thy Rule ? What dost thou with thy best Apparrell on ? You sir , what Trade are you ? Cobl . Truely Sir , in respect of a fine Workman , I am but as you would say , a Cobler Mur . But what Trade art thou ? Answer me directly Cob . A Trade Sir , that I hope I may vse , with a safe Conscience , which is indeed Sir , a Mender of bad soules Fla . What Trade thou knaue ? Thou naughty knaue , what Trade ? Cobl . Nay I beseech you Sir , be not out with me : yet if you be out Sir , I can mend you Mur . What mean ' st thou by that ? Mend mee , thou sawcy Fellow ? Cob . Why sir , Cobble you Fla . Thou art a Cobler , art thou ? Cob . Truly sir , all that I liue by , is with the Aule : I meddle with no Tradesmans matters , nor womens matters ; but withal I am indeed Sir , a Surgeon to old shooes : when they are in great danger , I recouer them . As proper men as euer trod vpon Neats Leather , haue gone vpon my handy - worke Fla . But wherefore art not in thy Shop to day ? Why do ' st thou leade these men about the streets ? Cob . Truly sir , to weare out their shooes , to get my selfe into more worke . But indeede sir , we make Holyday to see Caesar , and to reioyce in his Triumph Mur . Wherefore reioyce ? What Conquest brings he home ? What Tributaries follow him to Rome , To grace in Captiue bonds his Chariot Wheeles ? You Blockes , you stones , you worse then senslesse things : O you hard hearts , you cruell men of Rome , Knew you not Pompey many a time and oft ? Haue you climb ' d vp to Walles and Battlements , To Towres and Windowes ? Yea , to Chimney tops , Your Infants in your Armes , and there haue sate The liue - long day , with patient expectation , To see great Pompey passe the streets of Rome : And when you saw his Chariot but appeare , Haue you not made an Vniuersall shout , That Tyber trembled vnderneath her bankes To heare the replication of your sounds , Made in her Concaue Shores ? And do you now put on your best attyre ? And do you now cull out a Holyday ? And do you now strew Flowers in his way , That comes in Triumph ouer Pompeyes blood ? Be gone , Runne to your houses , fall vpon your knees , Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this Ingratitude Fla . Go , go , good Countrymen , and for this fault Assemble all the poore men of your sort ; Draw them to Tyber bankes , and weepe your teares Into the Channell , till the lowest streame Do kisse the most exalted Shores of all . Exeunt . all the Commoners . See where their basest mettle be not mou ' d , They vanish tongue - tyed in their guiltinesse : Go you downe that way towards the Capitoll , This way will I : Disrobe the Images , If you do finde them deckt with Ceremonies Mur . May we do so ? You know it is the Feast of Lupercall Fla . It is no matter , let no Images Be hung with Caesars Trophees : Ile about , And driue away the Vulgar from the streets ; So do you too , where you perceiue them thicke . These growing Feathers , pluckt from Caesars wing , Will make him flye an ordinary pitch , Who else would soare aboue the view of men , And keepe vs all in seruile fearefulnesse . Exeunt . Enter Caesar , Antony for the Course , Calphurnia , Portia , Decius , Cicero , Brutus , Cassius , Caska , a Soothsayer : after them Murellus and Flauius . Caes . Calphurnia Cask . Peace ho , Caesar speakes Caes . Calphurnia Calp . Heere my Lord Caes . Stand you directly in Antonio ' s way , When he doth run his course . Antonio Ant . Cæsar , my Lord Caes . Forget not in your speed Antonio , To touch Calphurnia : for our Elders say , The Barren touched in this holy chace , Shake off their sterrile curse Ant . I shall remember , When Caesar sayes , Do this ; it is perform ' d Caes . Set on , and leaue no Ceremony out Sooth . Caesar Caes . Ha ? Who calles ? Cask . Bid euery noyse be still : peace yet againe Caes . Who is it in the presse , that calles on me ? I heare a Tongue shriller then all the Musicke Cry , Caesar : Speake , Caesar is turn ' d to heare Sooth . Beware the Ides of March Caes . What man is that ? Br . A Sooth - sayer bids you beware the Ides of March Caes . Set him before me , let me see his face Cassi . Fellow , come from the throng , look vpon Caesar Caes . What sayst thou to me now ? Speak once againe , Sooth . Beware the Ides of March Caes . He is a Dreamer , let vs leaue him : Passe . Sennet Exeunt . Manet Brut . & Cass . Cassi . Will you go see the order of the course ? Brut . Not I Cassi . I pray you do Brut . I am not Gamesom : I do lacke some part Of that quicke Spirit that is in Antony : Let me not hinder Cassius your desires ; Ile leaue you Cassi . Brutus , I do obserue you now of late : I haue not from your eyes , that gentlenesse And shew of Loue , as I was wont to haue : You beare too stubborne , and too strange a hand Ouer your Friend , that loues you Bru . Cassius , Be not deceiu ' d : If I haue veyl ' d my looke , I turne the trouble of my Countenance Meerely vpon my selfe . Vexed I am Of late , with passions of some difference , Conceptions onely proper to my selfe , Which giue some soyle ( perhaps ) to my Behauiours : But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu ' d ( Among which number Cassius be you one ) Nor construe any further my neglect , Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre , Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men Cassi . Then Brutus , I haue much mistook your passion , By meanes whereof , this Brest of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value , worthy Cogitations . Tell me good Brutus , Can you see your face ? Brutus . No Cassius : For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection , By some other things Cassius . ' Tis iust , And it is very much lamented Brutus , That you haue no such Mirrors , as will turne Your hidden worthinesse into your eye , That you might see your shadow : I haue heard , Where many of the best respect in Rome , ( Except immortall Caesar ) speaking of Brutus , And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake , Haue wish ' d , that Noble Brutus had his eyes Bru . Into what dangers , would you Leade me Cassius ? That you would haue me seeke into my selfe , For that which is not in me ? Cas . Therefore good Brutus , be prepar ' d to heare : And since you know , you cannot see your selfe So well as by Reflection ; I your Glasse , Will modestly discouer to your selfe That of your selfe , which you yet know not of . And be not iealous on me , gentle Brutus : Were I a common Laughter , or did vse To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue To euery new Protester : if you know , That I do fawne on men , and hugge them hard , And after scandall them : Or if you know , That I professe my selfe in Banquetting To all the Rout , then hold me dangerous . Flourish , and Shout . Bru . What meanes this Showting ? I do feare , the People choose Caesar For their King Cassi . I , do you feare it ? Then must I thinke you would not haue it so Bru . I would not Cassius , yet I loue him well : But wherefore do you hold me heere so long ? What is it , that you would impart to me ? If it be ought toward the generall good , Set Honor in one eye , and Death i ' th other , And I will looke on both indifferently : For let the Gods so speed mee , as I loue The name of Honor , more then I feare death Cassi . I know that vertue to be in you Brutus , As well as I do know your outward fauour . Well , Honor is the subiect of my Story : I cannot tell , what you and other men Thinke of this life : But for my single selfe , I had as liefe not be , as liue to be In awe of such a Thing , as I my selfe . I was borne free as Caesar , so were you , We both haue fed as well , and we can both Endure the Winters cold , as well as hee . For once , vpon a Rawe and Gustie day , The troubled Tyber , chafing with her Shores , Caesar saide to me , Dar ' st thou Cassius now Leape in with me into this angry Flood , And swim to yonder Point ? Vpon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in , And bad him follow : so indeed he did . The Torrent roar ' d , and we did buffet it With lusty Sinewes , throwing it aside , And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie . But ere we could arriue the Point propos ' d , Caesar cride , Helpe me Cassius , or I sinke . I ( as Aeneas , our great Ancestor , Did from the Flames of Troy , vpon his shoulder The old Anchyses beare ) so , from the waues of Tyber Did I the tyred Caesar : And this Man , Is now become a God , and Cassius is A wretched Creature , and must bend his body , If Caesar carelesly but nod on him . He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine , And when the Fit was on him , I did marke How he did shake : Tis true , this God did shake , His Coward lippes did from their colour flye , And that same Eye , whose bend doth awe the World , Did loose his Lustre : I did heare him grone : I , and that Tongue of his , that bad the Romans Marke him , and write his Speeches in their Bookes , Alas , it cried , Giue me some drinke Titinius , As a sicke Girle : Ye Gods , it doth amaze me , A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the Maiesticke world , And beare the Palme alone . Shout . Flourish . Bru . Another generall shout ? I do beleeue , that these applauses are For some new Honors , that are heap ' d on Caesar Cassi . Why man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walke vnder his huge legges , and peepe about To finde our selues dishonourable Graues . Men at sometime , are Masters of their Fates . The fault ( deere Brutus ) is not in our Starres , But in our Selues , that we are vnderlings . Brutus and Caesar : What should be in that Caesar ? Why should that name be sounded more then yours Write them together : Yours , is as faire a Name : Sound them , it doth become the mouth aswell : Weigh them , it is as heauy : Coniure with ' em , Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar . Now in the names of all the Gods at once , Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede , That he is growne so great ? Age , thou art sham ' d . Rome , thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods . When went there by an Age , since the great Flood , But it was fam ' d with more then with one man ? When could they say ( till now ) that talk ' d of Rome , That her wide Walkes incompast but one man ? Now is it Rome indeed , and Roome enough When there is in it but one onely man . O ! you and I , haue heard our Fathers say , There was a Brutus once , that would haue brook ' d Th ' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome , As easily as a King Bru . That you do loue me , I am nothing iealous : What you would worke me too , I haue some ayme : How I haue thought of this , and of these times I shall recount heereafter . For this present , I would not so ( with loue I might intreat you ) Be any further moou ' d : What you haue said , I will consider : what you haue to say I will with patience heare , and finde a time Both meete to heare , and answer such high things . Till then , my Noble Friend , chew vpon this : Brutus had rather be a Villager , Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome Vnder these hard Conditions , as this time Is like to lay vpon vs Cassi . I am glad that my weake words Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus , Enter Caesar and his Traine . Bru . The Games are done , And Caesar is returning Cassi . As they passe by , Plucke Caska by the Sleeue , And he will ( after his sowre fashion ) tell you What hath proceeded worthy note to day Bru . I will do so : but looke you Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow , And all the rest , looke like a chidden Traine ; Calphurnia ' s Cheeke is pale , and Cicero Lookes with such Ferret , and such fiery eyes As we haue seene him in the Capitoll Being crost in Conference , by some Senators Cassi . Caska will tell vs what the matter is Caes Antonio Ant . Caesar Caes Let me haue men about me , that are fat , Sleeke - headed men , and such as sleepe a - nights : Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke , He thinkes too much : such men are dangerous Ant . Feare him not Caesar , he ' s not dangerous , He is a Noble Roman , and well giuen Caes Would he were fatter ; But I feare him not : Yet if my name were lyable to feare , I do not know the man I should auoyd So soone as that spare Cassius . He reades much , He is a great Obseruer , and he lookes Quite through the Deeds of men . He loues no Playes , As thou dost Antony : he heares no Musicke ; Seldome he smiles , and smiles in such a sort As if he mock ' d himselfe , and scorn ' d his spirit That could be mou ' d to smile at any thing . Such men as he , be neuer at hearts ease , Whiles they behold a greater then themselues , And therefore are they very dangerous . I rather tell thee what is to be fear ' d , Then what I feare : for alwayes I am Caesar . Come on my right hand , for this eare is deafe , And tell me truely , what thou think ' st of him . Sennit . Exeunt . Caesar and his Traine . Cask . You pul ' d me by the cloake , would you speake with me ? Bru . I Caska , tell vs what hath chanc ' d to day That Caesar lookes so sad Cask . Why you were with him , were you not ? Bru . I should not then aske Caska what had chanc ' d Cask . Why there was a Crowne offer ' d him ; & being offer ' d him , he put it by with the backe of his hand thus , and then the people fell a shouting Bru . What was the second noyse for ? Cask . Why for that too Cassi . They shouted thrice : what was the last cry for ? Cask . Why for that too Bru . Was the Crowne offer ' d him thrice ? Cask . I marry was ' t , and hee put it by thrice , euerie time gentler then other ; and at euery putting by , mine honest Neighbors showted Cassi . Who offer ' d him the Crowne ? Cask . Why Antony Bru . Tell vs the manner of it , gentle Caska Caska . I can as well bee hang ' d as tell the manner of it : It was meere Foolerie , I did not marke it . I sawe Marke Antony offer him a Crowne , yet ' twas not a Crowne neyther , ' twas one of these Coronets : and as I told you , hee put it by once : but for all that , to my thinking , he would faine haue had it . Then hee offered it to him againe : then hee put it by againe : but to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it . And then he offered it the third time ; hee put it the third time by , and still as hee refus ' d it , the rabblement howted , and clapp ' d their chopt hands , and threw vppe their sweatie Night - cappes , and vttered such a deale of stinking breath , because Caesar refus ' d the Crowne , that it had ( almost ) choaked Caesar : for hee swoonded , and fell downe at it : And for mine owne part , I durst not laugh , for feare of opening my Lippes , and receyuing the bad Ayre Cassi . But soft I pray you : what , did Caesar swound ? Cask . He fell downe in the Market - place , and foam ' d at mouth , and was speechlesse Brut . ' Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse Cassi . No , Caesar hath it not : but you , and I , And honest Caska , we haue the Falling sicknesse Cask . I know not what you meane by that , but I am sure Caesar fell downe . If the tag - ragge people did not clap him , and hisse him , according as he pleas ' d , and displeas ' d them , as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre , I am no true man Brut . What said he , when he came vnto himselfe ? Cask . Marry , before he fell downe , when he perceiu ' d the common Heard was glad he refus ' d the Crowne , he pluckt me ope his Doublet , and offer ' d them his Throat to cut : and I had beene a man of any Occupation , if I would not haue taken him at a word , I would I might goe to Hell among the Rogues , and so hee fell . When he came to himselfe againe , hee said , If hee had done , or said any thing amisse , he desir ' d their Worships to thinke it was his infirmitie . Three or foure Wenches where I stood , cryed , Alasse good Soule , and forgaue him with all their hearts : But there ' s no heed to be taken of them ; if Caesar had stab ' d their Mothers , they would haue done no lesse Brut . And after that , he came thus sad away Cask . I Cassi . Did Cicero say any thing ? Cask . I , he spoke Greeke Cassi . To what effect ? Cask . Nay , and I tell you that , Ile ne ' re looke you i ' th ' face againe . But those that vnderstood him , smil ' d at one another , and shooke their heads : but for mine owne part , it was Greeke to me . I could tell you more newes too : Murrellus and Flauius , for pulling Scarffes off Caesars Images , are put to silence . Fare you well . There was more Foolerie yet , if I could remember it Cassi . Will you suppe with me to Night , Caska ? Cask . No , I am promis ' d forth Cassi . Will you Dine with me to morrow ? Cask . I , if I be aliue , and your minde hold , and your Dinner worth the eating Cassi . Good , I will expect you Cask . Doe so : farewell both . Enter . Brut . What a blunt fellow is this growne to be ? He was quick Mettle , when he went to Schoole Cassi . So is he now , in execution Of any bold , or Noble Enterprize , How - euer he puts on this tardie forme : This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit , Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words With better Appetite Brut . And so it is : For this time I will leaue you : To morrow , if you please to speake with me , I will come home to you : or if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you Cassi . I will doe so : till then , thinke of the World . Exit Brutus . Well Brutus , thou art Noble : yet I see , Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos ' d : therefore it is meet , That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes : For who so firme , that cannot be seduc ' d ? Caesar doth beare me hard , but he loues Brutus . If I were Brutus now , and he were Cassius , He should not humor me . I will this Night , In seuerall Hands , in at his Windowes throw , As if they came from seuerall Citizens , Writings , all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his Name : wherein obscurely Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at . And after this , let Caesar seat him sure , For wee will shake him , or worse dayes endure . Enter . Thunder , and Lightning . Enter Caska , and Cicero . Cic . Good euen , Caska : brought you Caesar home ? Why are you breathlesse , and why stare you so ? Cask . Are not you mou ' d , when all the sway of Earth Shakes , like a thing vnfirme ? O Cicero , I haue seene Tempests , when the scolding Winds Haue riu ' d the knottie Oakes , and I haue seene Th ' ambitious Ocean swell , and rage , and foame , To be exalted with the threatning Clouds : But neuer till to Night , neuer till now , Did I goe through a Tempest - dropping - fire . Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen , Or else the World , too sawcie with the Gods , Incenses them to send destruction Cic . Why , saw you any thing more wonderfull ? Cask . A common slaue , you know him well by sight , Held vp his left Hand , which did flame and burne Like twentie Torches ioyn ' d ; and yet his Hand , Not sensible of fire , remain ' d vnscorch ' d . Besides , I ha ' not since put vp my Sword , Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon , Who glaz ' d vpon me , and went surly by , Without annoying me . And there were drawne Vpon a heape , a hundred gastly Women , Transformed with their feare , who swore , they saw Men , all in fire , walke vp and downe the streetes . And yesterday , the Bird of Night did sit , Euen at Noone - day , vpon the Market place , Howting , and shreeking . When these Prodigies Doe so conioyntly meet , let not men say , These are their Reasons , they are Naturall : For I beleeue , they are portentous things Vnto the Clymate , that they point vpon Cic . Indeed , it is a strange disposed time : But men may construe things after their fashion , Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues . Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow ? Cask . He doth : for he did bid Antonio Send word to you , he would be there to morrow Cic . Good - night then , Caska : This disturbed Skie is not to walke in Cask . Farewell Cicero . Exit Cicero . Enter Cassius . Cassi . Who ' s there ? Cask . A Romane Cassi . Caska , by your Voyce Cask . Your Eare is good . Cassius , what Night is this ? Cassi . A very pleasing Night to honest men Cask . Who euer knew the Heauens menace so ? Cassi . Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of faults . For my part , I haue walk ' d about the streets , Submitting me vnto the perillous Night ; And thus vnbraced , Caska , as you see , Haue bar ' d my Bosome to the Thunder - stone : And when the crosse blew Lightning seem ' d to open The Brest of Heauen , I did present my selfe Euen in the ayme , and very flash of it Cask . But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens ? It is the part of men , to feare and tremble , When the most mightie Gods , by tokens send Such dreadfull Heraulds , to astonish vs Cassi . You are dull , Caska : And those sparkes of Life , that should be in a Roman , You doe want , or else you vse not . You looke pale , and gaze , and put on feare , And cast your selfe in wonder , To see the strange impatience of the Heauens : But if you would consider the true cause , Why all these Fires , why all these gliding Ghosts , Why Birds and Beasts , from qualitie and kinde , Why Old men , Fooles , and Children calculate , Why all these things change from their Ordinance , Their Natures , and pre - formed Faculties , To monstrous qualitie ; why you shall finde , That Heauen hath infus ' d them with these Spirits , To make them Instruments of feare , and warning , Vnto some monstrous State . Now could I ( Caska ) name to thee a man , Most like this dreadfull Night , That Thunders , Lightens , opens Graues , and roares , As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll : A man no mightier then thy selfe , or me , In personall action ; yet prodigious growne , And fearefull , as these strange eruptions are Cask . ' Tis Caesar that you meane : Is it not , Cassius ? Cassi . Let it be who it is : for Romans now Haue Thewes , and Limbes , like to their Ancestors ; But woe the while , our Fathers mindes are dead , And we are gouern ' d with our Mothers spirits , Our yoake , and sufferance , shew vs Womanish Cask . Indeed , they say , the Senators to morrow Meane to establish Caesar as a King : And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea , and Land , In euery place , saue here in Italy Cassi . I know where I will weare this Dagger then ; Cassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius : Therein , yee Gods , you make the weake most strong ; Therein , yee Gods , you Tyrants doe defeat . Nor Stonie Tower , nor Walls of beaten Brasse , Nor ayre - lesse Dungeon , nor strong Linkes of Iron , Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit : But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres , Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe . If I know this , know all the World besides , That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare , I can shake off at pleasure . Thunder still . Cask . So can I : So euery Bond - man in his owne hand beares The power to cancell his Captiuitie Cassi . And why should Cæsar be a Tyrant then ? Poore man , I know he would not be a Wolfe , But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe : He were no Lyon , were not Romans Hindes . Those that with haste will make a mightie fire , Begin it with weake Strawes . What trash is Rome ? What Rubbish , and what Offall ? when it serues For the base matter , to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar . But oh Griefe , Where hast thou led me ? I ( perhaps ) speake this Before a willing Bond - man : then I know My answere must be made . But I am arm ' d , And dangers are to me indifferent Cask . You speake to Caska , and to such a man , That is no flearing Tell - tale . Hold , my Hand : Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes , And I will set this foot of mine as farre , As who goes farthest Cassi . There ' s a Bargaine made . Now know you , Caska , I haue mou ' d already Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans To vnder - goe , with me , an Enterprize , Of Honorable dangerous consequence ; And I doe know by this , they stay for me In Pompeyes Porch : for now this fearefull Night , There is no stirre , or walking in the streetes ; And the Complexion of the Element Is Fauors , like the Worke we haue in hand , Most bloodie , fierie , and most terrible . Enter Cinna . Caska . Stand close a while , for heere comes one in haste Cassi . ' Tis Cinna , I doe know him by his Gate , He is a friend . Cinna , where haste you so ? Cinna . To finde out you : Who ' s that , Metellus Cymber ? Cassi . No , it is Caska , one incorporate To our Attempts . Am I not stay ' d for , Cinna ? Cinna . I am glad on ' t . What a fearefull Night is this ? There ' s two or three of vs haue seene strange sights Cassi . Am I not stay ' d for ? tell me Cinna . Yes , you are . O Cassius , If you could but winne the Noble Brutus To our party - Cassi . Be you content . Good Cinna , take this Paper , And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre , Where Brutus may but finde it : and throw this In at his Window ; set this vp with Waxe Vpon old Brutus Statue : all this done , Repaire to Pompeyes Porch , where you shall finde vs . Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ? Cinna . All , but Metellus Cymber , and hee ' s gone To seeke you at your house . Well , I will hie , And so bestow these Papers as you bad me Cassi . That done , repayre to Pompeyes Theater . Exit Cinna . Come Caska , you and I will yet , ere day , See Brutus at his house : three parts of him Is ours alreadie , and the man entire Vpon the next encounter , yeelds him ours Cask . O , he sits high in all the Peoples hearts : And that which would appeare Offence in vs , His Countenance , like richest Alchymie , Will change to Vertue , and to Worthinesse Cassi . Him , and his worth , and our great need of him , You haue right well conceited : let vs goe , For it is after Mid - night , and ere day , We will awake him , and be sure of him . Exeunt . Actus Secundus . Enter Brutus in his Orchard . Brut . What Lucius , hoe ? I cannot , by the progresse of the Starres , Giue guesse how neere to day - Lucius , I say ? I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly . When Lucius , when ? awake , I say : what Lucius ? Enter Lucius . Luc . Call ' d you , my Lord ? Brut . Get me a Tapor in my Study , Lucius : When it is lighted , come and call me here Luc . I will , my Lord . Enter . Brut . It must be by his death : and for my part , I know no personall cause , to spurne at him , But for the generall . He would be crown ' d : How that might change his nature , there ' s the question ? It is the bright day , that brings forth the Adder , And that craues warie walking : Crowne him that , And then I graunt we put a Sting in him , That at his will he may doe danger with . Th ' abuse of Greatnesse , is , when it dis - ioynes Remorse from Power : And to speake truth of Caesar , I haue not knowne , when his Affections sway ' d More then his Reason . But ' tis a common proofe , That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder , Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face : But when he once attaines the vpmost Round , He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe , Lookes in the Clouds , scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend : so Caesar may ; Then least he may , preuent . And since the Quarrell Will beare no colour , for the thing he is , Fashion it thus ; that what he is , augmented , Would runne to these , and these extremities : And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge , Which hatch ' d , would as his kinde grow mischieuous ; And kill him in the shell . Enter Lucius . Luc . The Taper burneth in your Closet , Sir : Searching the Window for a Flint , I found This Paper , thus seal ' d vp , and I am sure It did not lye there when I went to Bed . Giues him the Letter . Brut . Get you to Bed againe , it is not day : Is not to morrow ( Boy ) the first of March ? Luc . I know not , Sir Brut . Looke in the Calender , and bring me word Luc . I will , Sir . Enter . Brut . The exhalations , whizzing in the ayre , Giue so much light , that I may reade by them . Opens the Letter , and reades . Brutus thou sleep ' st ; awake , and see thy selfe : Shall Rome , & c . speake , strike , redresse . Brutus , thou sleep ' st : awake . Such instigations haue beene often dropt , Where I haue tooke them vp : Shall Rome , & c . Thus must I piece it out : Shall Rome stand vnder one mans awe ? What Rome ? My Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome The Tarquin driue , when he was call ' d a King . Speake , strike , redresse . Am I entreated To speake , and strike ? O Rome , I make thee promise , If the redresse will follow , thou receiuest Thy full Petition at the hand of Brutus . Enter Lucius . Luc . Sir , March is wasted fifteene dayes . Knocke within . Brut . ' Tis good . Go to the Gate , some body knocks : Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I haue not slept . Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing , And the first motion , all the Interim is Like a Phantasma , or a hideous Dreame : The Genius , and the mortall Instruments Are then in councell ; and the state of a man , Like to a little Kingdome , suffers then The nature of an Insurrection . Enter Lucius . Luc . Sir , ' tis your Brother Cassius at the Doore , Who doth desire to see you Brut . Is he alone ? Luc . No , Sir , there are moe with him Brut . Doe you know them ? Luc . No , Sir , their Hats are pluckt about their Eares , And halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes , That by no meanes I may discouer them , By any marke of fauour Brut . Let ' em enter : They are the Faction . O Conspiracie , Sham ' st thou to shew thy dang ' rous Brow by Night , When euills are most free ? O then , by day Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough , To maske thy monstrous Visage ? Seek none Conspiracie , Hide it in Smiles , and Affabilitie : For if thou path thy natiue semblance on , Not Erebus it selfe were dimme enough , To hide thee from preuention . Enter the Conspirators , Cassius , Caska , Decius , Cinna , Metellus , and Trebonius . Cass . I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest : Good morrow Brutus , doe we trouble you ? Brut . I haue beene vp this howre , awake all Night : Know I these men , that come along with you ? Cass . Yes , euery man of them ; and no man here But honors you : and euery one doth wish , You had but that opinion of your selfe , Which euery Noble Roman beares of you . This is Trebonius Brut . He is welcome hither Cass . This , Decius Brutus Brut . He is welcome too Cass . This , Caska ; this , Cinna ; and this , Metellus Cymber Brut . They are all welcome . What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues Betwixt your Eyes , and Night ? Cass . Shall I entreat a word ? They whisper . Decius . Here lyes the East : doth not the Day breake heere ? Cask . No Cin . O pardon , Sir , it doth ; and yon grey Lines , That fret the Clouds , are Messengers of Day Cask . You shall confesse , that you are both deceiu ' d : Heere , as I point my Sword , the Sunne arises , Which is a great way growing on the South , Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare . Some two moneths hence , vp higher toward the North He first presents his fire , and the high East Stands as the Capitoll , directly heere Bru . Giue me your hands all ouer , one by one Cas . And let vs sweare our Resolution Brut . No , not an Oath : if not the Face of men , The sufferance of our Soules , the times Abuse ; If these be Motiues weake , breake off betimes , And euery man hence , to his idle bed : So let high - sighted - Tyranny range on , Till each man drop by Lottery . But if these ( As I am sure they do ) beare fire enough To kindle Cowards , and to steele with valour The melting Spirits of women . Then Countrymen , What neede we any spurre , but our owne cause To pricke vs to redresse ? What other Bond , Then secret Romans , that haue spoke the word , And will not palter ? And what other Oath , Then Honesty to Honesty ingag ' d , That this shall be , or we will fall for it . Sweare Priests and Cowards , and men Cautelous Old feeble Carrions , and such suffering Soules That welcome wrongs : Vnto bad causes , sweare Such Creatures as men doubt ; but do not staine The euen vertue of our Enterprize , Nor th ' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits , To thinke , that or our Cause , or our Performance Did neede an Oath . When euery drop of blood That euery Roman beares , and Nobly beares Is guilty of a seuerall Bastardie , If he do breake the smallest Particle Of any promise that hath past from him Cas . But what of Cicero ? Shall we sound him ? I thinke he will stand very strong with vs Cask . Let vs not leaue him out Cyn . No , by no meanes Metel . O let vs haue him , for his Siluer haires Will purchase vs a good opinion : And buy mens voyces , to commend our deeds : It shall be sayd , his iudgement rul ' d our hands , Our youths , and wildenesse , shall no whit appeare , But all be buried in his Grauity Bru . O name him not ; let vs not breake with him , For he will neuer follow any thing That other men begin Cas . Then leaue him out Cask . Indeed , he is not fit Decius . Shall no man else be toucht , but onely Caesar ? Cas . Decius well vrg ' d : I thinke it is not meet , Marke Antony , so well belou ' d of Caesar , Should out - liue Caesar , we shall finde of him A shrew ' d Contriuer . And you know , his meanes If he improue them , may well stretch so farre As to annoy vs all : which to preuent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together Bru . Our course will seeme too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the Head off , and then hacke the Limbes : Like Wrath in death , and Enuy afterwards : For Antony , is but a Limbe of Caesar . Let ' s be Sacrificers , but not Butchers Caius : We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar , And in the Spirit of men , there is no blood : O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit , And not dismember Caesar ! But ( alas ) Caesar must bleed for it . And gentle Friends , Let ' s kill him Boldly , but not Wrathfully : Let ' s carue him , as a Dish fit for the Gods , Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds : And let our Hearts , as subtle Masters do , Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage , And after seeme to chide ' em . This shall make Our purpose Necessary , and not Enuious . Which so appearing to the common eyes , We shall be call ' d Purgers , not Murderers . And for Marke Antony , thinke not of him : For he can do no more then Caesars Arme , When Caesars head is off Cas . Yet I feare him , For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar Bru . Alas , good Cassius , do not thinke of him : If he loue Caesar , all that he can do Is to himselfe ; take thought , and dye for Caesar , And that were much he should : for he is giuen To sports , to wildenesse , and much company Treb . There is no feare in him ; let him not dye , For he will liue , and laugh at this heereafter . Clocke strikes . Bru . Peace , count the Clocke Cas . The Clocke hath stricken three Treb . ' Tis time to part Cass . But it is doubtfull yet , Whether Caesar will come forth to day , or no : For he is Superstitious growne of late , Quite from the maine Opinion he held once , Of Fantasie , of Dreames , and Ceremonies : It may be , these apparant Prodigies , The vnaccustom ' d Terror of this night , And the perswasion of his Augurers , May hold him from the Capitoll to day Decius . Neuer feare that : If he be so resolu ' d , I can ore - sway him : For he loues to heare , That Vnicornes may be betray ' d with Trees , And Beares with Glasses , Elephants with Holes , Lyons with Toyles , and men with Flatterers . But , when I tell him , he hates Flatterers , He sayes , he does ; being then most flattered . Let me worke : For I can giue his humour the true bent ; And I will bring him to the Capitoll Cas . Nay , we will all of vs , be there to fetch him Bru . By the eight houre , is that the vttermost ? Cin . Be that the vttermost , and faile not then Met . Caius Ligarius doth beare Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey ; I wonder none of you haue thought of him Bru . Now good Metellus go along by him : He loues me well , and I haue giuen him Reasons , Send him but hither , and Ile fashion him Cas . The morning comes vpon ' s : Wee ' l leaue you Brutus , And Friends disperse your selues ; but all remember What you haue said , and shew your selues true Romans Bru . Good Gentlemen , looke fresh and merrily , Let not our lookes put on our purposes , But beare it as our Roman Actors do , With vntyr ' d Spirits , and formall Constancie , And so good morrow to you euery one . Exeunt . Manet Brutus . Boy : Lucius : Fast asleepe ? It is no matter , Enioy the hony - heauy - Dew of Slumber : Thou hast no Figures , nor no Fantasies , Which busie care drawes , in the braines of men ; Therefore thou sleep ' st so sound . Enter Portia . Por . Brutus , my Lord Bru . Portia : What meane you ? wherfore rise you now ? It is not for your health , thus to commit Your weake condition , to the raw cold morning Por . Nor for yours neither . Y ' haue vngently Brutus Stole from my bed : and yesternight at Supper You sodainly arose , and walk ' d about , Musing , and sighing , with your armes acrosse And when I ask ' d you what the matter was , You star ' d vpon me , with vngentle lookes . I vrg ' d you further , then you scratch ' d your head , And too impatiently stampt with your foote : Yet I insisted , yet you answer ' d not , But with an angry wafter of your hand Gaue signe for me to leaue you : So I did , Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem ' d too much inkindled ; and withall , Hoping it was but an effect of Humor , Which sometime hath his houre with euery man . It will not let you eate , nor talke , nor sleepe ; And could it worke so much vpon your shape , As it hath much preuayl ' d on your Condition , I should not know you Brutus . Deare my Lord , Make me acquainted with your cause of greefe Bru . I am not well in health , and that is all Por . Brutus is wise , and were he not in health , He would embrace the meanes to come by it Bru . Why so I do : good Portia go to bed Por . Is Brutus sicke ? And is it Physicall To walke vnbraced , and sucke vp the humours Of the danke Morning ? What , is Brutus sicke ? And will he steale out of his wholsome bed To dare the vile contagion of the Night ? And tempt the Rhewmy , and vnpurged Ayre , To adde vnto his sicknesse ? No my Brutus , You haue some sicke Offence within your minde , Which by the Right and Vertue of my place I ought to know of : And vpon my knees , I charme you , by my once commended Beauty , By all your vowes of Loue , and that great Vow Which did incorporate and make vs one , That you vnfold to me , your selfe ; your halfe Why you are heauy : and what men to night Haue had resort to you : for heere haue beene Some sixe or seuen , who did hide their faces Euen from darknesse Bru . Kneele not gentle Portia Por . I should not neede , if you were gentle Brutus . Within the Bond of Marriage , tell me Brutus , Is it excepted , I should know no Secrets That appertaine to you ? Am I your Selfe , But as it were in sort , or limitation ? To keepe with you at Meales , comfort your Bed , And talke to you sometimes ? Dwell I but in the Suburbs Of your good pleasure ? If it be no more , Portia is Brutus Harlot , not his Wife Bru . You are my true and honourable Wife , As deere to me , as are the ruddy droppes That visit my sad heart Por . If this were true , then should I know this secret . I graunt I am a Woman ; but withall , A Woman that Lord Brutus tooke to Wife : I graunt I am a Woman ; but withall , A Woman well reputed : Cato ' s Daughter . Thinke you , I am no stronger then my Sex Being so Father ' d , and so Husbanded ? Tell me your Counsels , I will not disclose ' em : I haue made strong proofe of my Constancie , Giuing my selfe a voluntary wound Heere , in the Thigh : Can I beare that with patience , And not my Husbands Secrets ? Bru . O ye Gods ! Render me worthy of this Noble Wife . Knocke . Harke , harke , one knockes : Portia go in a while , And by and by thy bosome shall partake The secrets of my Heart . All my engagements , I will construe to thee , All the Charractery of my sad browes : Leaue me with hast . Exit Portia . Enter Lucius and Ligarius . Lucius , who ' s that knockes Luc . Heere is a sicke man that would speak with you Bru . Caius Ligarius , that Metellus spake of . Boy , stand aside . Caius Ligarius , how ? Cai . Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue Bru . O what a time haue you chose out braue Caius To weare a Kerchiefe ? Would you were not sicke Cai . I am not sicke , if Brutus haue in hand Any exploit worthy the name of Honor Bru . Such an exploit haue I in hand Ligarius , Had you a healthfull eare to heare of it Cai . By all the Gods that Romans bow before , I heere discard my sicknesse . Soule of Rome , Braue Sonne , deriu ' d from Honourable Loines , Thou like an Exorcist , hast coniur ' d vp My mortified Spirit . Now bid me runne , And I will striue with things impossible , Yea get the better of them . What ' s to do ? Bru . A peece of worke , That will make sicke men whole Cai . But are not some whole , that we must make sicke ? Bru . That must we also . What it is my Caius , I shall vnfold to thee , as we are going , To whom it must be done Cai . Set on your foote , And with a heart new - fir ' d , I follow you , To do I know not what : but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on . Thunder Bru . Follow me then . Exeunt . Thunder & Lightning Enter Iulius Caesar in his Night - gowne . Caesar . Nor Heauen , nor Earth , Haue beene at peace to night : Thrice hath Calphurnia , in her sleepe cryed out , Helpe , ho : They murther Caesar . Who ' s within ? Enter a Seruant . Ser . My Lord Caes Go bid the Priests do present Sacrifice , And bring me their opinions of Successe Ser . I will my Lord . Exit Enter Calphurnia . Cal . What mean you Caesar ? Think you to walk forth ? You shall not stirre out of your house to day Caes Caesar shall forth ; the things that threaten ' d me , Ne ' re look ' d but on my backe : When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished Calp . Caesar , I neuer stood on Ceremonies , Yet now they fright me : There is one within , Besides the things that we haue heard and seene , Recounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch . A Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets , And Graues haue yawn ' d , and yeelded vp their dead ; Fierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds In Rankes and Squadrons , and right forme of Warre Which drizel ' d blood vpon the Capitoll : The noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre : Horsses do neigh , and dying men did grone , And Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets . O Caesar , these things are beyond all vse , And I do feare them Caes What can be auoyded Whose end is purpos ' d by the mighty Gods ? Yet Caesar shall go forth : for these Predictions Are to the world in generall , as to Caesar Calp . When Beggers dye , there are no Comets seen , The Heauens themselues blaze forth the death of Princes Caes Cowards dye many times before their deaths , The valiant neuer taste of death but once : Of all the Wonders that I yet haue heard , It seemes to me most strange that men should feare , Seeing that death , a necessary end Will come , when it will come . Enter a Seruant . What say the Augurers ? Ser . They would not haue you to stirre forth to day . Plucking the intrailes of an Offering forth , They could not finde a heart within the beast Caes The Gods do this in shame of Cowardice : Caesar should be a Beast without a heart If he should stay at home to day for feare : No Caesar shall not ; Danger knowes full well That Caesar is more dangerous then he . We heare two Lyons litter ' d in one day , And I the elder and more terrible , And Caesar shall go foorth Calp . Alas my Lord , Your wisedome is consum ' d in confidence : Do not go forth to day : Call it my feare , That keepes you in the house , and not your owne . Wee ' l send Mark Antony to the Senate house , And he shall say , you are not well to day : Let me vpon my knee , preuaile in this Caes Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And for thy humor , I will stay at home . Enter Decius . Heere ' s Decius Brutus , he shall tell them so Deci . Caesar , all haile : Good morrow worthy Caesar , I come to fetch you to the Senate house Caes And you are come in very happy time , To beare my greeting to the Senators , And tell them that I will not come to day : Cannot , is false : and that I dare not , falser : I will not come to day , tell them so Decius Calp . Say he is sicke Caes Shall Caesar send a Lye ? Haue I in Conquest stretcht mine Arme so farre , To be afear ' d to tell Gray - beards the truth : Decius , go tell them , Caesar will not come Deci . Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laught at when I tell them so Caes The cause is in my Will , I will not come , That is enough to satisfie the Senate . But for your priuate satisfaction , Because I loue you , I will let you know . Calphurnia heere my wife , stayes me at home : She dreampt to night , she saw my Statue , Which like a Fountaine , with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood : and many lusty Romans Came smiling , & did bathe their hands in it : And these does she apply , for warnings and portents , And euils imminent ; and on her knee Hath begg ' d , that I will stay at home to day Deci . This Dreame is all amisse interpreted , It was a vision , faire and fortunate : Your Statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bath ' d , Signifies , that from you great Rome shall sucke Reuiuing blood , and that great men shall presse For Tinctures , Staines , Reliques , and Cognisance . This by Calphurnia ' s Dreame is signified Caes And this way haue you well expounded it Deci . I haue , when you haue heard what I can say : And know it now , the Senate haue concluded To giue this day , a Crowne to mighty Caesar . If you shall send them word you will not come , Their mindes may change . Besides , it were a mocke Apt to be render ' d , for some one to say , Breake vp the Senate , till another time : When Caesars wife shall meete with better Dreames . If Caesar hide himselfe , shall they not whisper Loe Caesar is affraid ? Pardon me Caesar , for my deere deere loue To your proceeding , bids me tell you this : And reason to my loue is liable Caes How foolish do your fears seeme now Calphurnia ? I am ashamed I did yeeld to them . Giue me my Robe , for I will go . Enter Brutus , Ligarius , Metellus , Caska , Trebonius , Cynna , and Publius . And looke where Publius is come to fetch me Pub . Good morrow Caesar Caes Welcome Publius . What Brutus , are you stirr ' d so earely too ? Good morrow Caska : Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne ' re so much your enemy , As that same Ague which hath made you leane . What is ' t a Clocke ? Bru . Caesar , ' tis strucken eight Caes I thanke you for your paines and curtesie . Enter Antony . See , Antony that Reuels long a - nights Is notwithstanding vp . Good morrow Antony Ant . So to most Noble Caesar Caes Bid them prepare within : I am too blame to be thus waited for . Now Cynna , now Metellus : what Trebonius , I haue an houres talke in store for you : Remember that you call on me to day : Be neere me , that I may remember you Treb . Caesar I will : and so neere will I be , That your best Friends shall wish I had beene further Caes Good Friends go in , and taste some wine with me . And we ( like Friends ) will straight way go together Bru . That euery like is not the same , O Caesar , The heart of Brutus earnes to thinke vpon . Exeunt . Enter Artemidorus . Caesar , beware of Brutus , take heede of Cassius ; come not neere Caska , haue an eye to Cynna , trust not Trebonius , marke well Metellus Cymber , Decius Brutus loues thee not : Thou hast wrong ' d Caius Ligarius . There is but one minde in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar : If thou beest not Immortall , looke about you : Security giues way to Conspiracie . The mighty Gods defend thee . Thy Louer , Artemidorus . Heere will I stand , till Caesar passe along , And as a Sutor will I giue him this : My heart laments , that Vertue cannot liue Out of the teeth of Emulation . If thou reade this , O Caesar , thou mayest liue ; If not , the Fates with Traitors do contriue . Enter . Enter Portia and Lucius . Por . I prythee Boy , run to the Senate - house , Stay not to answer me , but get thee gone . Why doest thou stay ? Luc . To know my errand Madam Por . I would haue had thee there and heere agen Ere I can tell thee what thou should ' st do there : O Constancie , be strong vpon my side , Set a huge Mountaine ' tweene my Heart and Tongue : I haue a mans minde , but a womans might : How hard it is for women to keepe counsell . Art thou heere yet ? Luc . Madam , what should I do ? Run to the Capitoll , and nothing else ? And so returne to you , and nothing else ? Por . Yes , bring me word Boy , if thy Lord look well , For he went sickly forth : and take good note What Caesar doth , what Sutors presse to him . Hearke Boy , what noyse is that ? Luc . I heare none Madam Por . Prythee listen well : I heard a bussling Rumor like a Fray , And the winde brings it from the Capitoll Luc . Sooth Madam , I heare nothing . Enter the Soothsayer . Por . Come hither Fellow , which way hast thou bin ? Sooth . At mine owne house , good Lady Por . What is ' t a clocke ? Sooth . About the ninth houre Lady Por . Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitoll ? Sooth . Madam not yet , I go to take my stand , To see him passe on to the Capitoll Por . Thou hast some suite to Caesar , hast thou not ? Sooth . That I haue Lady , if it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar , as to heare me : I shall beseech him to befriend himselfe Por . Why know ' st thou any harme ' s intended towards him ? Sooth . None that I know will be , Much that I feare may chance : Good morrow to you : heere the street is narrow : The throng that followes Caesar at the heeles , Of Senators , of Praetors , common Sutors , Will crowd a feeble man ( almost ) to death : Ile get me to a place more voyd , and there Speake to great Caesar as he comes along . Exit Por . I must go in : Aye me ! How weake a thing The heart of woman is ? O Brutus , The Heauens speede thee in thine enterprize . Sure the Boy heard me : Brutus hath a suite That Caesar will not grant . O , I grow faint : Run Lucius , and commend me to my Lord , Say I am merry ; Come to me againe , And bring me word what he doth say to thee . Exeunt . Actus Tertius . Flourish Enter Caesar , Brutus , Cassius , Caska , Decius , Metellus , Trebonius , Cynna , Antony , Lepidus , Artimedorus , Publius , and the Soothsayer . Caes The Ides of March are come Sooth .

I wish your enterprize to day may thriue Cassi . What enterprize Popillius ? Popil . Fare you well Bru . What said Popillius Lena ? Cassi . He wisht to day our enterprize might thriue : I feare our purpose is discouered Bru . Looke how he makes to Caesar : marke him Cassi . Caska be sodaine , for we feare preuention . Brutus what shall be done ? If this be knowne , Cassius or Caesar neuer shall turne backe , For I will slay my selfe Bru . Cassius be constant : Popillius Lena speakes not of our purposes , For looke he smiles , and Caesar doth not change Cassi . Trebonius knowes his time : for look you Brutus He drawes Mark Antony out of the way Deci . Where is Metellus Cimber , let him go , And presently preferre his suite to Caesar Bru .

Most high , most mighty , and most puisant Caesar Metellus Cymber throwes before thy Seate An humble heart Caes I must preuent thee Cymber : These couchings , and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men , And turne pre - Ordinance , and first Decree Into the lane of Children . Be not fond , To thinke that Caesar beares such Rebell blood That will be thaw ' d from the true quality With that which melteth Fooles , I meane sweet words , Low - crooked - curtsies , and base Spaniell fawning : Thy Brother by decree is banished : If thou doest bend , and pray , and fawne for him , I spurne thee like a Curre out of my way : Know , Caesar doth not wrong , nor without cause Will he be satisfied Metel . Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne , To sound more sweetly in great Caesars eare , For the repealing of my banish ' d Brother ? Bru . I kisse thy hand , but not in flattery Caesar : Desiring thee , that Publius Cymber may Haue an immediate freedome of repeale Caes What Brutus ? Cassi . Pardon Caesar : Caesar pardon : As lowe as to thy foote doth Cassius fall , To begge infranchisement for Publius Cymber Caes I could be well mou ' d , if I were as you , If I could pray to mooue , Prayers would mooue me : But I am constant as the Northerne Starre , Of whose true fixt , and resting quality , There is no fellow in the Firmament . The Skies are painted with vnnumbred sparkes , They are all Fire , and euery one doth shine : But , there ' s but one in all doth hold his place . So , in the World ; ' Tis furnish ' d well with Men , And Men are Flesh and Blood , and apprehensiue ; Yet in the number , I do know but One That vnassayleable holds on his Ranke , Vnshak ' d of Motion : and that I am he , Let me a little shew it , euen in this : That I was constant Cymber should be banish ' d , And constant do remaine to keepe him so Cinna .

Where is Antony ? Treb . Fled to his House amaz ' d : Men , Wiues , and Children , stare , cry out , and run , As it were Doomesday Bru . Fates , we will know your pleasures : That we shall dye we know , ' tis but the time And drawing dayes out , that men stand vpon Cask . Why he that cuts off twenty yeares of life , Cuts off so many yeares of fearing death Bru . Grant that , and then is Death a Benefit : So are we Caesars Friends , that haue abridg ' d His time of fearing death . Stoope Romans , stoope , And let vs bathe our hands in Caesars blood Vp to the Elbowes , and besmeare our Swords : Then walke we forth , euen to the Market place , And wauing our red Weapons o ' re our heads , Let ' s all cry Peace , Freedome , and Liberty Cassi . Stoop then , and wash . How many Ages hence Shall this our lofty Scene be acted ouer , In State vnborne , and Accents yet vnknowne ? Bru . How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport , That now on Pompeyes Basis lye along , No worthier then the dust ? Cassi . So oft as that shall be , So often shall the knot of vs be call ' d , The Men that gaue their Country liberty Dec . What , shall we forth ? Cassi . I , euery man away . Brutus shall leade , and we will grace his heeles With the most boldest , and best hearts of Rome . Enter a Seruant . Bru . Soft , who comes heere ? A friend of Antonies Ser . Thus Brutus did my Master bid me kneele ; Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall downe , And being prostrate , thus he bad me say : Brutus is Noble , Wise , Valiant , and Honest ; Caesar was Mighty , Bold , Royall , and Louing : Say , I loue Brutus , and I honour him ; Say , I fear ' d Caesar , honour ' d him , and lou ' d him . If Brutus will vouchsafe , that Antony May safely come to him , and be resolu ' d How Caesar hath deseru ' d to lye in death , Mark Antony , shall not loue Caesar dead So well as Brutus liuing ; but will follow The Fortunes and Affayres of Noble Brutus , Thorough the hazards of this vntrod State , With all true Faith . So sayes my Master Antony Bru . Thy Master is a Wise and Valiant Romane , I neuer thought him worse : Tell him , so please him come vnto this place He shall be satisfied : and by my Honor Depart vntouch ' d Ser . Ile fetch him presently . Exit Seruant . Bru . I know that we shall haue him well to Friend Cassi . I wish we may : But yet haue I a minde That feares him much : and my misgiuing still Falles shrewdly to the purpose . Enter Antony . Bru . But heere comes Antony : Welcome Mark Antony Ant . O mighty Caesar ! Dost thou lye so lowe ? Are all thy Conquests , Glories , Triumphes , Spoiles , Shrunke to this little Measure ? Fare thee well . I know not Gentlemen what you intend , Who else must be let blood , who else is ranke : If I my selfe , there is no houre so fit As Caesars deaths houre ; nor no Instrument Of halfe that worth , as those your Swords ; made rich With the most Noble blood of all this World . I do beseech yee , if you beare me hard , Now , whil ' st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake , Fulfill your pleasure . Liue a thousand yeeres , I shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye . No place will please me so , no meane of death , As heere by Caesar , and by you cut off , The Choice and Master Spirits of this Age Bru . O Antony ! Begge not your death of vs : Though now we must appeare bloody and cruell , As by our hands , and this our present Acte You see we do : Yet see you but our hands , And this , the bleeding businesse they haue done : Our hearts you see not , they are pittifull : And pitty to the generall wrong of Rome , As fire driues out fire , so pitty , pitty Hath done this deed on Caesar . For your part , To you , our Swords haue leaden points Marke Antony : Our Armes in strength of malice , and our Hearts Of Brothers temper , do receiue you in , With all kinde loue , good thoughts , and reuerence Cassi . Your voyce shall be as strong as any mans , In the disposing of new Dignities Bru . Onely be patient , till we haue appeas ' d The Multitude , beside themselues with feare , And then , we will deliuer you the cause , Why I , that did loue Caesar when I strooke him , Haue thus proceeded Ant . I doubt not of your Wisedome : Let each man render me his bloody hand . First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you ; Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand ; Now Decius Brutus yours ; now yours Metellus ; Yours Cinna ; and my valiant Caska , yours ; Though last , not least in loue , yours good Trebonius . Gentlemen all : Alas , what shall I say , My credit now stands on such slippery ground , That one of two bad wayes you must conceit me , Either a Coward , or a Flatterer . That I did loue thee Caesar , O ' tis true : If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now , Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death , To see thy Antony making his peace , Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes ? Most Noble , in the presence of thy Coarse , Had I as many eyes , as thou hast wounds , Weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood , It would become me better , then to close In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies . Pardon me Iulius , heere was ' t thou bay ' d braue Hart , Heere did ' st thou fall , and heere thy Hunters stand Sign ' d in thy Spoyle , and Crimson ' d in thy Lethee . O World ! thou wast the Forrest to this Hart , And this indeed , O World , the Hart of thee . How like a Deere , stroken by many Princes , Dost thou heere lye ? Cassi . Mark Antony Ant . Pardon me Caius Cassius : The Enemies of Caesar , shall say this : Then , in a Friend , it is cold Modestie Cassi . I blame you not for praising Caesar so . But what compact meane you to haue with vs ? Will you be prick ' d in number of our Friends , Or shall we on , and not depend on you ? Ant . Therefore I tooke your hands , but was indeed Sway ' d from the point , by looking downe on Caesar . Friends am I with you all , and loue you all , Vpon this hope , that you shall giue me Reasons , Why , and wherein , Caesar was dangerous Bru . Or else were this a sauage Spectacle : Our Reasons are so full of good regard , That were you Antony , the Sonne of Caesar , You should be satisfied Ant . That ' s all I seeke , And am moreouer sutor , that I may Produce his body to the Market - place , And in the Pulpit as becomes a Friend , Speake in the Order of his Funerall Bru . You shall Marke Antony Cassi . Brutus , a word with you : You know not what you do ; Do not consent That Antony speake in his Funerall : Know you how much the people may be mou ' d By that which he will vtter Bru . By your pardon : I will my selfe into the Pulpit first , And shew the reason of our Caesars death . What Antony shall speake , I will protest He speakes by leaue , and by permission : And that we are contented Caesar shall Haue all true Rites , and lawfull Ceremonies , It shall aduantage more , then do vs wrong Cassi . I know not what may fall , I like it not Bru . Mark Antony , heere take you Caesars body : You shall not in your Funerall speech blame vs , But speake all good you can deuise of Caesar , And say you doo ' t by our permission : Else shall you not haue any hand at all About his Funerall . And you shall speake In the same Pulpit whereto I am going , After my speech is ended Ant . Be it so : I do desire no more Bru . Prepare the body then , and follow vs . Exeunt . Manet Antony . O pardon me , thou bleeding peece of Earth : That I am meeke and gentle with these Butchers . Thou art the Ruines of the Noblest man That euer liued in the Tide of Times . Woe to the hand that shed this costly Blood . Ouer thy wounds , now do I Prophesie , ( Which like dumbe mouthes do ope their Ruby lips , To begge the voyce and vtterance of my Tongue ) A Curse shall light vpon the limbes of men ; Domesticke Fury , and fierce Ciuill strife , Shall cumber all the parts of Italy : Blood and destruction shall be so in vse , And dreadfull Obiects so familiar , That Mothers shall but smile , when they behold Their Infants quartered with the hands of Warre : All pitty choak ' d with custome of fell deeds , And Caesars Spirit ranging for Reuenge , With Ate by his side , come hot from Hell , Shall in these Confines , with a Monarkes voyce , Cry hauocke , and let slip the Dogges of Warre , That this foule deede , shall smell aboue the earth With Carrion men , groaning for Buriall . Enter Octauio ' s Seruant . You serue Octauius Caesar , do you not ? Ser . I do Marke Antony Ant . Caesar did write for him to come to Rome Ser . He did receiue his Letters , and is comming , And bid me say to you by word of mouth - O Caesar ! Ant . Thy heart is bigge : get thee a - part and weepe : Passion I see is catching from mine eyes , Seeing those Beads of sorrow stand in thine , Began to water . Is thy Master comming ? Ser . He lies to night within seuen Leagues of Rome Ant . Post backe with speede , And tell him what hath chanc ' d : Heere is a mourning Rome , a dangerous Rome , No Rome of safety for Octauius yet , Hie hence , and tell him so . Yet stay a - while , Thou shalt not backe , till I haue borne this course Into the Market place : There shall I try In my Oration , how the People take The cruell issue of these bloody men , According to the which , thou shalt discourse To yong Octauius , of the state of things . Lend me your hand . Exeunt . Enter Brutus and goes into the Pulpit , and Cassius , with the Plebeians . Ple . We will be satisfied : let vs be satisfied Bru . Then follow me , and giue me Audience friends . Cassius go you into the other streete , And part the Numbers : Those that will heare me speake , let ' em stay heere ; Those that will follow Cassius , go with him , And publike Reasons shall be rendred Of Caesars death 1 . Ple . I will heare Brutus speake 2 . I will heare Cassius , and compare their Reasons , When seuerally we heare them rendred 3 . The Noble Brutus is ascended : Silence Bru . Be patient till the last . Romans , Countrey - men , and Louers , heare mee for my cause , and be silent , that you may heare . Beleeue me for mine Honor , and haue respect to mine Honor , that you may beleeue . Censure me in your Wisedom , and awake your Senses , that you may the better Iudge . If there bee any in this Assembly , any deere Friend of Caesars , to him I say , that Brutus loue to Caesar , was no lesse then his . If then , that Friend demand , why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer : Not that I lou ' d Caesar lesse , but that I lou ' d Rome more . Had you rather Caesar were liuing , and dye all Slaues ; then that Caesar were dead , to liue all Free - men ? As Caesar lou ' d mee , I weepe for him ; as he was Fortunate , I reioyce at it ; as he was Valiant , I honour him : But , as he was Ambitious , I slew him . There is Teares , for his Loue : Ioy , for his Fortune : Honor , for his Valour : and Death , for his Ambition . Who is heere so base , that would be a Bondman ? If any , speak , for him haue I offended . Who is heere so rude , that would not be a Roman ? If any , speak , for him haue I offended . Who is heere so vile , that will not loue his Countrey ? If any , speake , for him haue I offended . I pause for a Reply All . None Brutus , none Brutus . Then none haue I offended . I haue done no more to Caesar , then you shall do to Brutus . The Question of his death , is inroll ' d in the Capitoll : his Glory not extenuated , wherein he was worthy ; nor his offences enforc ' d , for which he suffered death . Enter Mark Antony , with Caesars body . Heere comes his Body , mourn ' d by Marke Antony , who though he had no hand in his death , shall receiue the benefit of his dying , a place in the Co [ m ] monwealth , as which of you shall not . With this I depart , that as I slewe my best Louer for the good of Rome , I haue the same Dagger for my selfe , when it shall please my Country to need my death All . Liue Brutus , liue , liue 1 . Bring him with Triumph home vnto his house 2 . Giue him a Statue with his Ancestors 3 . Let him be Caesar 4 . Caesars better parts , Shall be Crown ' d in Brutus 1 . Wee ' l bring him to his House , With Showts and Clamors Bru . My Country - men 2 . Peace , silence , Brutus speakes 1 . Peace ho Bru . Good Countrymen , let me depart alone , And ( for my sake ) stay heere with Antony : Do grace to Caesars Corpes , and grace his Speech Tending to Caesars Glories , which Marke Antony ( By our permission ) is allow ' d to make . I do intreat you , not a man depart , Saue I alone , till Antony haue spoke . Exit 1 Stay ho , and let vs heare Mark Antony 3 Let him go vp into the publike Chaire , Wee ' l heare him : Noble Antony go vp Ant . For Brutus sake , I am beholding to you 4 What does he say of Brutus ? 3 He sayes , for Brutus sake He findes himselfe beholding to vs all 4 ' Twere best he speake no harme of Brutus heere ? 1 This Caesar was a Tyrant 3 Nay that ' s certaine : We are blest that Rome is rid of him 2 Peace , let vs heare what Antony can say Ant . You gentle Romans All . Peace hoe , let vs heare him An . Friends , Romans , Countrymen , lend me your ears : I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him : The euill that men do , liues after them , The good is oft enterred with their bones , So let it be with Caesar . The Noble Brutus , Hath told you Caesar was Ambitious : If it were so , it was a greeuous Fault , And greeuously hath Caesar answer ' d it . Heere , vnder leaue of Brutus , and the rest ( For Brutus is an Honourable man , So are they all ; all Honourable men ) Come I to speake in Caesars Funerall . He was my Friend , faithfull , and iust to me ; But Brutus sayes , he was Ambitious , And Brutus is an Honourable man . He hath brought many Captiues home to Rome , Whose Ransomes , did the generall Coffers fill : Did this in Caesar seeme Ambitious ? When that the poore haue cry ' de , Caesar hath wept : Ambition should be made of sterner stuffe , Yet Brutus sayes , he was Ambitious : And Brutus is an Honourable man . You all did see , that on the Lupercall , I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne , Which he did thrice refuse . Was this Ambition ? Yet Brutus sayes , he was Ambitious : And sure he is an Honourable man . I speake not to disprooue what Brutus spoke , But heere I am , to speake what I do know ; You all did loue him once , not without cause , What cause with - holds you then , to mourne for him ? O Iudgement ! thou are fled to brutish Beasts , And Men haue lost their Reason . Beare with me , My heart is in the Coffin there with Caesar , And I must pawse , till it come backe to me 1 Me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings 2 If thou consider rightly of the matter , Caesar ha ' s had great wrong 3 Ha ' s hee Masters ? I feare there will a worse come in his place 4 . Mark ' d ye his words ? he would not take y Crown , Therefore ' tis certaine , he was not Ambitious 1 . If it be found so , some will deere abide it 2 . Poore soule , his eyes are red as fire with weeping 3 . There ' s not a Nobler man in Rome then Antony 4 . Now marke him , he begins againe to speake Ant . But yesterday , the word of Caesar might Haue stood against the World : Now lies he there , And none so poore to do him reuerence . O Maisters ! If I were dispos ' d to stirre Your hearts and mindes to Mutiny and Rage , I should do Brutus wrong , and Cassius wrong : Who ( you all know ) are Honourable men . I will not do them wrong : I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong my selfe and you , Then I will wrong such Honourable men . But heere ' s a Parchment , with the Seale of Caesar , I found it in his Closset , ' tis his Will : Let but the Commons heare this Testament : ( Which pardon me ) I do not meane to reade , And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds , And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood ; Yea , begge a haire of him for Memory , And dying , mention it within their Willes , Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie Vnto their issue 4 Wee ' l heare the Will , reade it Marke Antony All . The Will , the Will ; we will heare Caesars Will Ant . Haue patience gentle Friends , I must not read it . It is not meete you know how Caesar lou ' d you : You are not Wood , you are not Stones , but men : And being men , hearing the Will of Caesar , It will inflame you , it will make you mad : ' Tis good you know not that you are his Heires , For if you should , O what would come of it ? 4 Read the Will , wee ' l heare it Antony : You shall reade vs the Will , Caesars Will Ant . Will you be Patient ? Will you stay a - while ? I haue o ' re - shot my selfe to tell you of it , I feare I wrong the Honourable men , Whose Daggers haue stabb ' d Caesar : I do feare it 4 They were Traitors : Honourable men ? All . The Will , the Testament 2 They were Villaines , Murderers : the Will , read the Will Ant . You will compell me then to read the Will : Then make a Ring about the Corpes of Caesar , And let me shew you him that made the Will : Shall I descend ? And will you giue me leaue ? All . Come downe 2 Descend 3 You shall haue leaue 4 A Ring , stand round 1 Stand from the Hearse , stand from the Body 2 Roome for Antony , most Noble Antony Ant . Nay presse not so vpon me , stand farre off All . Stand backe : roome , beare backe Ant . If you haue teares , prepare to shed them now . You all do know this Mantle , I remember The first time euer Caesar put it on , ' Twas on a Summers Euening in his Tent , That day he ouercame the Neruij . Looke , in this place ran Cassius Dagger through : See what a rent the enuious Caska made : Through this , the wel - beloued Brutus stabb ' d , And as he pluck ' d his cursed Steele away : Marke how the blood of Caesar followed it , As rushing out of doores , to be resolu ' d If Brutus so vnkindely knock ' d , or no : For Brutus , as you know , was Caesars Angel . Iudge , O you Gods , how deerely Caesar lou ' d him : This was the most vnkindest cut of all . For when the Noble Caesar saw him stab , Ingratitude , more strong then Traitors armes , Quite vanquish ' d him : then burst his Mighty heart , And in his Mantle , muffling vp his face , Euen at the Base of Pompeyes Statue ( Which all the while ran blood ) great Caesar fell . O what a fall was there , my Countrymen ? Then I , and you , and all of vs fell downe , Whil ' st bloody Treason flourish ' d ouer vs . O now you weepe , and I perceiue you feele The dint of pitty : These are gracious droppes . Kinde Soules , what weepe you , when you but behold Our Caesars Vesture wounded ? Looke you heere , Heere is Himselfe , marr ' d as you see with Traitors 1 . O pitteous spectacle ! 2 . O Noble Caesar ! 3 . O wofull day ! 4 . O Traitors , Villaines ! 1 . O most bloody sight ! 2 . We will be reueng ' d : Reuenge About , seeke , burne , fire , kill , slay , Let not a Traitor liue Ant . Stay Country - men 1 . Peace there , heare the Noble Antony 2 . Wee ' l heare him , wee ' l follow him , wee ' l dy with him Ant . Good Friends , sweet Friends , let me not stirre you vp To such a sodaine Flood of Mutiny : They that haue done this Deede , are honourable . What priuate greefes they haue , alas I know not , That made them do it : They are Wise , and Honourable , And will no doubt with Reasons answer you . I come not ( Friends ) to steale away your hearts , I am no Orator , as Brutus is : But ( as you know me all ) a plaine blunt man That loue my Friend , and that they know full well , That gaue me publike leaue to speake of him : For I haue neyther writ nor words , nor worth , Action , nor Vtterance , nor the power of Speech , To stirre mens Blood . I onely speake right on : I tell you that , which you your selues do know , Shew you sweet Caesars wounds , poor poor dum mouths And bid them speake for me : But were I Brutus , And Brutus Antony , there were an Antony Would ruffle vp your Spirits , and put a Tongue In euery Wound of Caesar , that should moue The stones of Rome , to rise and Mutiny All . Wee ' l Mutiny 1 Wee ' l burne the house of Brutus 3 Away then , come , seeke the Conspirators Ant . Yet heare me Countrymen , yet heare me speake All . Peace hoe , heare Antony , most Noble Antony Ant . Why Friends , you go to do you know not what : Wherein hath Caesar thus deseru ' d your loues ? Alas you know not , I must tell you then : You haue forgot the Will I told you of All . Most true , the Will , let ' s stay and heare the Wil Ant . Heere is the Will , and vnder Caesars Seale : To euery Roman Citizen he giues , To euery seuerall man , seuenty fiue Drachmaes 2 Ple . Most Noble Caesar , wee ' l reuenge his death 3 Ple . O Royall Caesar Ant . Heare me with patience All . Peace hoe Ant . Moreouer , he hath left you all his Walkes , His priuate Arbors , and new - planted Orchards , On this side Tyber , he hath left them you , And to your heyres for euer : common pleasures To walke abroad , and recreate your selues . Heere was a Caesar : when comes such another ? 1 . Ple . Neuer , neuer : come , away , away : Wee ' l burne his body in the holy place , And with the Brands fire the Traitors houses . Take vp the body 2 . Ple . Go fetch fire 3 . Ple . Plucke downe Benches 4 . Ple . Plucke downe Formes , Windowes , any thing . Exit Plebeians . Ant . Now let it worke : Mischeefe thou art a - foot , Take thou what course thou wilt . How now Fellow ? Enter Seruant . Ser . Sir , Octauius is already come to Rome Ant . Where is hee ? Ser . He and Lepidus are at Caesars house Ant . And thither will I straight , to visit him : He comes vpon a wish . Fortune is merry , And in this mood will giue vs any thing Ser . I heard him say , Brutus and Cassius Are rid like Madmen through the Gates of Rome Ant . Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moued them . Bring me to Octauius . Exeunt . Enter Cinna the Poet , and after him the Plebeians . Cinna . I dreamt to night , that I did feast with Caesar , And things vnluckily charge my Fantasie : I haue no will to wander foorth of doores , Yet something leads me foorth 1 . What is your name ? 2 . Whether are you going ? 3 . Where do you dwell ? 4 . Are you a married man , or a Batchellor ? 2 . Answer euery man directly 1 . I , and breefely 4 . I , and wisely 3 . I , and truly , you were best Cin . What is my name ? Whether am I going ? Where do I dwell ? Am I a married man , or a Batchellour ? Then to answer euery man , directly and breefely , wisely and truly : wisely I say , I am a Batchellor 2 That ' s as much as to say , they are fooles that marrie : you ' l beare me a bang for that I feare : proceede directly Cinna . Directly I am going to Caesars Funerall 1 . As a Friend , or an Enemy ? Cinna . As a friend 2 . That matter is answered directly 4 . For your dwelling : breefely Cinna . Breefely , I dwell by the Capitoll 3 . Your name sir , truly Cinna . Truly , my name is Cinna 1 . Teare him to peeces , hee ' s a Conspirator Cinna . I am Cinna the Poet , I am Cinna the Poet 4 . Teare him for his bad verses , teare him for his bad Verses Cin . I am not Cinna the Conspirator 4 . It is no matter , his name ' s Cinna , plucke but his name out of his heart , and turne him going 3 . Teare him , tear him ; Come Brands hoe , Firebrands : to Brutus , to Cassius , burne all . Some to Decius House , and some to Caska ' s ; some to Ligarius : Away , go . Exeunt . all the Plebeians . Actus Quartus . Enter Antony , Octauius , and Lepidus . Ant . These many then shall die , their names are prickt Octa . Your Brother too must dye : consent you Lepidus ? Lep . I do consent Octa . Pricke him downe Antony Lep . Vpon condition Publius shall not liue , Who is your Sisters sonne , Marke Antony Ant . He shall not liue ; looke , with a spot I dam him . But Lepidus , go you to Caesars house : Fetch the Will hither , and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in Legacies Lep . What ? shall I finde you heere ? Octa . Or heere , or at the Capitoll . Exit Lepidus Ant . This is a slight vnmeritable man , Meet to be sent on Errands : is it fit The three - fold World diuided , he should stand One of the three to share it ? Octa . So you thought him , And tooke his voyce who should be prickt to dye In our blacke Sentence and Proscription Ant . Octauius , I haue seene more dayes then you , And though we lay these Honours on this man , To ease our selues of diuers sland ' rous loads , He shall but beare them , as the Asse beares Gold , To groane and swet vnder the Businesse , Either led or driuen , as we point the way : And hauing brought our Treasure , where we will , Then take we downe his Load , and turne him off ( Like to the empty Asse ) to shake his eares , And graze in Commons Octa . You may do your will : But hee ' s a tried , and valiant Souldier Ant . So is my Horse Octauius , and for that I do appoint him store of Prouender . It is a Creature that I teach to fight , To winde , to stop , to run directly on : His corporall Motion , gouern ' d by my Spirit , And in some taste , is Lepidus but so : He must be taught , and train ' d , and bid go forth : A barren spirited Fellow ; one that feeds On Obiects , Arts , and Imitations . Which out of vse , and stal ' de by other men Begin his fashion . Do not talke of him , But as a property : and now Octauius , Listen great things . Brutus and Cassius Are leuying Powers ; We must straight make head : Therefore let our Alliance be combin ' d , Our best Friends made , our meanes stretcht , And let vs presently go sit in Councell , How couert matters may be best disclos ' d , And open Perils surest answered Octa . Let vs do so : for we are at the stake , And bayed about with many Enemies , And some that smile haue in their hearts I feare Millions of Mischeefes . Exeunt . Drum . Enter Brutus , Lucillius , and the Army . Titinius and Pindarus meete them . Bru . Stand ho Lucil . Giue the word ho , and Stand Bru . What now Lucillius , is Cassius neere ? Lucil . He is at hand , and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his Master Bru . He greets me well . Your Master Pindarus In his owne change , or by ill Officers , Hath giuen me some worthy cause to wish Things done , vndone : But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied Pin . I do not doubt But that my Noble Master will appeare Such as he is , full of regard , and Honour Bru . He is not doubted . A word Lucillius How he receiu ' d you : let me be resolu ' d Lucil . With courtesie , and with respect enough , But not with such familiar instances , Nor with such free and friendly Conference As he hath vs ' d of old Bru . Thou hast describ ' d A hot Friend , cooling : Euer note Lucillius , When Loue begins to sicken and decay It vseth an enforced Ceremony . There are no trickes , in plaine and simple Faith : But hollow men , like Horses hot at hand , Make gallant shew , and promise of their Mettle : Low March within . But when they should endure the bloody Spurre , They fall their Crests , and like deceitfull Iades Sinke in the Triall . Comes his Army on ? Lucil . They meane this night in Sardis to be quarter ' d : The greater part , the Horse in generall Are come with Cassius . Enter Cassius and his Powers . Bru . Hearke , he is arriu ' d : March gently on to meete him Cassi . Stand ho Bru . Stand ho , speake the word along . Stand . Stand . Stand Cassi . Most Noble Brother , you haue done me wrong Bru . Iudge me you Gods ; wrong I mine Enemies ? And if not so , how should I wrong a Brother Cassi . Brutus , this sober forme of yours , hides wrongs , And when you do them - Brut . Cassius , be content , Speake your greefes softly , I do know you well . Before the eyes of both our Armies heere ( Which should perceiue nothing but Loue from vs ) Let vs not wrangle . Bid them moue away : Then in my Tent Cassius enlarge your Greefes , And I will giue you Audience Cassi . Pindarus , Bid our Commanders leade their Charges off A little from this ground Bru . Lucillius , do you the like , and let no man Come to our Tent , till we haue done our Conference . Let Lucius and Titinius guard our doore . Exeunt . Manet Brutus and Cassius . Cassi . That you haue wrong ' d me , doth appear in this : You haue condemn ' d , and noted Lucius Pella For taking Bribes heere of the Sardians ; Wherein my Letters , praying on his side , Because I knew the man was slighted off Bru . You wrong ' d your selfe to write in such a case Cassi . In such a time as this , it is not meet That euery nice offence should beare his Comment Bru . Let me tell you Cassius , you your selfe Are much condemn ' d to haue an itching Palme , To sell , and Mart your Offices for Gold To Vndeseruers Cassi . I , an itching Palme ? You know that you are Brutus that speakes this , Or by the Gods , this speech were else your last Bru . The name of Cassius Honors this corruption , And Chasticement doth therefore hide his head Cassi . Chasticement ? Bru . Remember March , the Ides of March reme [ m ] ber : Did not great Iulius bleede for Iustice sake ? What Villaine touch ' d his body , that did stab , And not for Iustice ? What ? Shall one of Vs , That strucke the Formost man of all this World , But for supporting Robbers : shall we now , Contaminate our fingers , with base Bribes ? And sell the mighty space of our large Honors For so much trash , as may be grasped thus ? I had rather be a Dogge , and bay the Moone , Then such a Roman Cassi . Brutus , baite not me , Ile not indure it : you forget your selfe To hedge me in . I am a Souldier , I , Older in practice , Abler then your selfe To make Conditions Bru . Go too : you are not Cassius Cassi . I am Bru . I say , you are not Cassi . Vrge me no more , I shall forget my selfe : Haue minde vpon your health : Tempt me no farther Bru . Away slight man Cassi . Is ' t possible ? Bru . Heare me , for I will speake . Must I giue way , and roome to your rash Choller ? Shall I be frighted , when a Madman stares ? Cassi . O ye Gods , ye Gods , Must I endure all this ? Bru . All this ? I more : Fret till your proud hart break . Go shew your Slaues how Chollericke you are , And make your Bondmen tremble . Must I bouge ? Must I obserue you ? Must I stand and crouch Vnder your Testie Humour ? By the Gods , You shall digest the Venom of your Spleene Though it do Split you . For , from this day forth , Ile vse you for my Mirth , yea for my Laughter When you are Waspish Cassi . Is it come to this ? Bru . You say , you are a better Souldier : Let it appeare so ; make your vaunting true , And it shall please me well . For mine owne part , I shall be glad to learne of Noble men Cass . You wrong me euery way : You wrong me Brutus : I saide , an Elder Souldier , not a Better . Did I say Better ? Bru . If you did , I care not Cass . When Caesar liu ' d , he durst not thus haue mou ' d me Brut . Peace , peace , you durst not so haue tempted him Cassi . I durst not Bru . No Cassi . What ? durst not tempt him ? Bru . For your life you durst not Cassi . Do not presume too much vpon my Loue , I may do that I shall be sorry for Bru . You haue done that you should be sorry for . There is no terror Cassius in your threats : For I am Arm ' d so strong in Honesty , That they passe by me , as the idle winde , Which I respect not . I did send to you For certaine summes of Gold , which you deny ' d me , For I can raise no money by vile meanes : By Heauen , I had rather Coine my Heart , And drop my blood for Drachmaes , then to wring From the hard hands of Peazants , their vile trash By any indirection . I did send To you for Gold to pay my Legions , Which you deny ' d me : was that done like Cassius ? Should I haue answer ' d Caius Cassius so ? When Marcus Brutus growes so Couetous , To locke such Rascall Counters from his Friends , Be ready Gods with all your Thunder - bolts , Dash him to peeces Cassi . I deny ' d you not Bru . You did Cassi . I did not . He was but a Foole That brought my answer back . Brutus hath riu ' d my hart : A Friend should beare his Friends infirmities ; But Brutus makes mine greater then they are Bru . I do not , till you practice them on me Cassi . You loue me not Bru . I do not like your faults Cassi . A friendly eye could neuer see such faults Bru . A Flatterers would not , though they do appeare As huge as high Olympus Cassi . Come Antony , and yong Octauius come , Reuenge your selues alone on Cassius , For Cassius is a - weary of the World : Hated by one he loues , brau ' d by his Brother , Check ' d like a bondman , all his faults obseru ' d , Set in a Note - booke , learn ' d , and con ' d by roate To cast into my Teeth . O I could weepe My Spirit from mine eyes . There is my Dagger , And heere my naked Breast : Within , a Heart Deerer then Pluto ' s Mine , Richer then Gold : If that thou bee ' st a Roman , take it foorth . I that deny ' d thee Gold , will giue my Heart : Strike as thou did ' st at Caesar : For I know , When thou did ' st hate him worst , y loued ' st him better Then euer thou loued ' st Cassius Bru . Sheath your Dagger : Be angry when you will , it shall haue scope : Do what you will , Dishonor , shall be Humour . O Cassius , you are yoaked with a Lambe That carries Anger , as the Flint beares fire , Who much inforced , shewes a hastie Sparke , And straite is cold agen Cassi . Hath Cassius liu ' d To be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus , When greefe and blood ill temper ' d , vexeth him ? Bru . When I spoke that , I was ill temper ' d too Cassi . Do you confesse so much ? Giue me your hand Bru . And my heart too Cassi . O Brutus ! Bru . What ' s the matter ? Cassi . Haue not you loue enough to beare with me , When that rash humour which my Mother gaue me Makes me forgetfull Bru . Yes Cassius , and from henceforth When you are ouer - earnest with your Brutus , Hee ' l thinke your Mother chides , and leaue you so . Enter a Poet . Poet . Let me go in to see the Generals , There is some grudge betweene ' em , ' tis not meete They be alone Lucil . You shall not come to them Poet . Nothing but death shall stay me Cas . How now ? What ' s the matter ? Poet . For shame you Generals ; what do you meane ? Loue , and be Friends , as two such men should bee , For I haue seene more yeeres I ' me sure then yee Cas . Ha , ha , how vildely doth this Cynicke rime ? Bru . Get you hence sirra : Sawcy Fellow , hence Cas . Beare with him Brutus , ' tis his fashion Brut . Ile know his humor , when he knowes his time : What should the Warres do with these Iigging Fooles ? Companion , hence Cas . Away , away be gone . Exit Poet Bru . Lucillius and Titinius bid the Commanders Prepare to lodge their Companies to night Cas . And come your selues , & bring Messala with you Immediately to vs Bru . Lucius , a bowle of Wine Cas . I did not thinke you could haue bin so angry Bru . O Cassius , I am sicke of many greefes Cas . Of your Philosophy you make no vse , If you giue place to accidentall euils Bru . No man beares sorrow better . Portia is dead Cas . Ha ? Portia ? Bru . She is dead Cas . How scap ' d I killing , when I crost you so ? O insupportable , and touching losse ! Vpon what sicknesse ? Bru . Impatient of my absence , And greefe , that yong Octauius with Mark Antony Haue made themselues so strong : For with her death That tydings came . With this she fell distract , And ( her Attendants absent ) swallow ' d fire Cas . And dy ' d so ? Bru . Euen so Cas . O ye immortall Gods ! Enter Boy with Wine , and Tapers . Bru . Speak no more of her : Giue me a bowl of wine , In this I bury all vnkindnesse Cassius . Drinkes Cas . My heart is thirsty for that Noble pledge . Fill Lucius , till the Wine ore - swell the Cup : I cannot drinke too much of Brutus loue . Enter Titinius and Messala . Brutus . Come in Titinius : Welcome good Messala : Now sit we close about this Taper heere , And call in question our necessities Cass . Portia , art thou gone ? Bru . No more I pray you . Messala , I haue heere receiued Letters , That yong Octauius , and Marke Antony Come downe vpon vs with a mighty power , Bending their Expedition toward Philippi Mess . My selfe haue Letters of the selfe - same Tenure Bru . With what Addition Mess . That by proscription , and billes of Outlarie , Octauius , Antony , and Lepidus , Haue put to death , an hundred Senators Bru . Therein our Letters do not well agree : Mine speake of seuenty Senators , that dy ' de By their proscriptions , Cicero being one Cassi . Cicero one ? Messa . Cicero is dead , and by that order of proscription Had you your Letters from your wife , my Lord ? Bru . No Messala Messa . Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her ? Bru . Nothing Messala Messa . That me thinkes is strange Bru . Why aske you ? Heare you ought of her , in yours ? Messa . No my Lord Bru . Now as you are a Roman tell me true Messa . Then like a Roman , beare the truth I tell , For certaine she is dead , and by strange manner Bru . Why farewell Portia : We must die Messala : With meditating that she must dye once , I haue the patience to endure it now Messa . Euen so great men , great losses shold indure Cassi . I haue as much of this in Art as you , But yet my Nature could not beare it so Bru . Well , to our worke aliue . What do you thinke Of marching to Philippi presently Cassi . I do not thinke it good Bru . Your reason ? Cassi . This it is : ' Tis better that the Enemie seeke vs , So shall he waste his meanes , weary his Souldiers , Doing himselfe offence , whil ' st we lying still , Are full of rest , defence , and nimblenesse Bru . Good reasons must of force giue place to better : The people ' twixt Philippi , and this ground Do stand but in a forc ' d affection : For they haue grug ' d vs Contribution . The Enemy , marching along by them , By them shall make a fuller number vp , Come on refresht , new added , and encourag ' d : From which aduantage shall we cut him off . If at Philippi we do face him there , These people at our backe Cassi . Heare me good Brother Bru . Vnder your pardon . You must note beside , That we haue tride the vtmost of our Friends : Our Legions are brim full , our cause is ripe , The Enemy encreaseth euery day , We at the height , are readie to decline . There is a Tide in the affayres of men , Which taken at the Flood , leades on to Fortune : Omitted , all the voyage of their life , Is bound in Shallowes , and in Miseries . On such a full Sea are we now a - float , And we must take the current when it serues , Or loose our Ventures Cassi . Then with your will go on : wee ' l along Our selues , and meet them at Philippi Bru . The deepe of night is crept vpon our talke , And Nature must obey Necessitie , Which we will niggard with a little rest : There is no more to say Cassi . No more , good night , Early to morrow will we rise , and hence . Enter Lucius . Bru . Lucius my Gowne : farewell good Messala , Good night Titinius : Noble , Noble Cassius , Good night , and good repose Cassi . O my deere Brother : This was an ill beginning of the night : Neuer come such diuision ' tweene our soules : Let it not Brutus . Enter Lucius with the Gowne . Bru . Euery thing is well Cassi . Good night my Lord Bru . Good night good Brother Tit . Messa . Good night Lord Brutus Bru . Farwell euery one . Exeunt . Giue me the Gowne . Where is thy Instrument ? Luc . Heere in the Tent Bru . What , thou speak ' st drowsily ? Poore knaue I blame thee not , thou art ore - watch ' d . Call Claudio , and some other of my men , Ile haue them sleepe on Cushions in my Tent Luc . Varrus , and Claudio . Enter Varrus and Claudio . Var . Cals my Lord ? Bru . I pray you sirs , lye in my Tent and sleepe , It may be I shall raise you by and by On businesse to my Brother Cassius Var . So please you , we will stand , And watch your pleasure Bru . I will it not haue it so : Lye downe good sirs , It may be I shall otherwise bethinke me . Looke Lucius , heere ' s the booke I sought for so : I put it in the pocket of my Gowne Luc . I was sure your Lordship did not giue it me Bru . Beare with me good Boy , I am much forgetfull . Canst thou hold vp thy heauie eyes a - while , And touch thy Instrument a straine or two Luc . I my Lord , an ' t please you Bru . It does my Boy : I trouble thee too much , but thou art willing Luc . It is my duty Sir Brut . I should not vrge thy duty past thy might , I know yong bloods looke for a time of rest Luc . I haue slept my Lord already Bru . It was well done , and thou shalt sleepe againe : I will not hold thee long . If I do liue , I will be good to thee . Musicke , and a Song . This is a sleepy Tune : O Murd ' rous slumber ! Layest thou thy Leaden Mace vpon my Boy , That playes thee Musicke ? Gentle knaue good night : I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee : If thou do ' st nod , thou break ' st thy Instrument , Ile take it from thee , and ( good Boy ) good night . Let me see , let me see ; is not the Leafe turn ' d downe Where I left reading ? Heere it is I thinke . Enter the Ghost of Caesar . How ill this Taper burnes . Ha ! Who comes heere ? I thinke it is the weakenesse of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous Apparition . It comes vpon me : Art thou any thing ? Art thou some God , some Angell , or some Diuell , That mak ' st my blood cold , and my haire to stare ? Speake to me , what thou art Ghost . Thy euill Spirit Brutus ? Bru . Why com ' st thou ? Ghost . To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi Brut . Well : then I shall see thee againe ? Ghost . I , at Philippi Brut . Why I will see thee at Philippi then : Now I haue taken heart , thou vanishest . Ill Spirit , I would hold more talke with thee . Boy , Lucius , Varrus , Claudio , Sirs : Awake : Claudio Luc . The strings my Lord , are false Bru . He thinkes he still is at his Instrument . Lucius , awake Luc . My Lord Bru . Did ' st thou dreame Lucius , that thou so cryedst out ? Luc . My Lord , I do not know that I did cry Bru . Yes that thou did ' st : Did ' st thou see any thing ? Luc . Nothing my Lord Bru . Sleepe againe Lucius : Sirra Claudio , Fellow , Thou : Awake Var . My Lord Clau . My Lord Bru . Why did you so cry out sirs , in your sleepe ? Both . Did we my Lord ? Bru . I : saw you any thing ? Var . No my Lord , I saw nothing Clau . Nor I my Lord Bru . Go , and commend me to my Brother Cassius : Bid him set on his Powres betimes before , And we will follow Both . It shall be done my Lord . Exeunt . Actus Quintus . Enter Octauius , Antony , and their Army . Octa . Now Antony , our hopes are answered , You said the Enemy would not come downe , But keepe the Hilles and vpper Regions : It proues not so : their battailes are at hand , They meane to warne vs at Philippi heere : Answering before we do demand of them Ant . Tut I am in their bosomes , and I know Wherefore they do it : They could be content To visit other places , and come downe With fearefull brauery : thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they haue Courage ; But ' tis not so . Enter a Messenger . Mes . Prepare you Generals , The Enemy comes on in gallant shew : Their bloody signe of Battell is hung out , And something to be done immediately Ant . Octauius , leade your Battaile softly on Vpon the left hand of the euen Field Octa . Vpon the right hand I , keepe thou the left Ant . Why do you crosse me in this exigent Octa . I do not crosse you : but I will do so . March . Drum . Enter Brutus , Cassius , & their Army . Bru . They stand , and would haue parley Cassi . Stand fast Titinius , we must out and talke Octa . Mark Antony , shall we giue signe of Battaile ? Ant . No Caesar , we will answer on their Charge . Make forth , the Generals would haue some words Oct . Stirre not vntill the Signall Bru . Words before blowes : is it so Countrymen ? Octa . Not that we loue words better , as you do Bru . Good words are better then bad strokes Octauius An . In your bad strokes Brutus , you giue good words Witnesse the hole you made in Caesars heart , Crying long liue , Haile Caesar Cassi . Antony , The posture of your blowes are yet vnknowne ; But for your words , they rob the Hibla Bees , And leaue them Hony - lesse Ant . Not stinglesse too Bru . O yes , and soundlesse too : For you haue stolne their buzzing Antony , And very wisely threat before you sting Ant . Villains : you did not so , when your vile daggers Hackt one another in the sides of Caesar : You shew ' d your teethes like Apes , And fawn ' d like Hounds , And bow ' d like Bondmen , kissing Caesars feete ; Whil ' st damned Caska , like a Curre , behinde Strooke Caesar on the necke . O you Flatterers Cassi . Flatterers ? Now Brutus thanke your selfe , This tongue had not offended so to day . If Cassius might haue rul ' d Octa . Come , come , the cause . If arguing make vs swet , The proofe of it will turne to redder drops : Looke , I draw a Sword against Conspirators , When thinke you that the Sword goes vp againe ? Neuer till Caesars three and thirtie wounds Be well aueng ' d ; or till another Caesar Haue added slaughter to the Sword of Traitors Brut . Caesar , thou canst not dye by Traitors hands . Vnlesse thou bring ' st them with thee Octa . So I hope : I was not borne to dye on Brutus Sword Bru . O if thou wer ' t the Noblest of thy Straine , Yong - man , thou could ' st not dye more honourable Cassi . A peeuish School - boy , worthles of such Honor Ioyn ' d with a Masker , and a Reueller Ant . Old Cassius still Octa . Come Antony : away : Defiance Traitors , hurle we in your teeth . If you dare fight to day , come to the Field ; If not , when you haue stomackes . Exit Octauius , Antony , and Army Cassi . Why now blow winde , swell Billow , And swimme Barke : The Storme is vp , and all is on the hazard Bru . Ho Lucillius , hearke , a word with you . Lucillius and Messala stand forth . Luc . My Lord Cassi . Messala Messa . What sayes my Generall ? Cassi . Messala , this is my Birth - day : at this very day Was Cassius borne . Giue me thy hand Messala : Be thou my witnesse , that against my will ( As Pompey was ) am I compell ' d to set Vpon one Battell all our Liberties . You know , that I held Epicurus strong , And his Opinion : Now I change my minde , And partly credit things that do presage . Comming from Sardis , on our former Ensigne Two mighty Eagles fell , and there they pearch ' d , Gorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands , Who to Philippi heere consorted vs : This Morning are they fled away , and gone , And in their steeds , do Rauens , Crowes , and Kites Fly ore our heads , and downward looke on vs As we were sickely prey ; their shadowes seeme A Canopy most fatall , vnder which Our Army lies , ready to giue vp the Ghost Messa . Beleeue not so Cassi . I but beleeue it partly , For I am fresh of spirit , and resolu ' d To meete all perils , very constantly Bru . Euen so Lucillius Cassi . Now most Noble Brutus , The Gods to day stand friendly , that we may Louers in peace , leade on our dayes to age . But since the affayres of men rests still incertaine , Let ' s reason with the worst that may befall . If we do lose this Battaile , then is this The very last time we shall speake together : What are you then determined to do ? Bru . Euen by the rule of that Philosophy , By which I did blame Cato , for the death Which he did giue himselfe , I know not how : But I do finde it Cowardly , and vile , For feare of what might fall , so to preuent The time of life , arming my selfe with patience , To stay the prouidence of some high Powers , That gouerne vs below Cassi . Then , if we loose this Battaile , You are contented to be led in Triumph Thorow the streets of Rome Bru . No Cassius , no : Thinke not thou Noble Romane , That euer Brutus will go bound to Rome , He beares too great a minde . But this same day Must end that worke , the Ides of March begun . And whether we shall meete againe , I know not : Therefore our euerlasting farewell take : For euer , and for euer , farewell Cassius , If we do meete againe , why we shall smile ; If not , why then this parting was well made Cassi . For euer , and for euer , farewell Brutus : If we do meete againe , wee ' l smile indeede ; If not , ' tis true , this parting was well made Bru . Why then leade on . O that a man might know The end of this dayes businesse , ere it come : But it sufficeth , that the day will end , And then the end is knowne . Come ho , away . Exeunt . Alarum . Enter Brutus and Messala . Bru . Ride , ride Messala , ride and giue these Billes Vnto the Legions , on the other side . Lowd Alarum . Let them set on at once : for I perceiue But cold demeanor in Octauio ' s wing : And sodaine push giues them the ouerthrow : Ride , ride Messala , let them all come downe . Exeunt . Alarums . Enter Cassius and Titinius . Cassi . O looke Titinius , looke , the Villaines flye : My selfe haue to mine owne turn ' d Enemy : This Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe , I slew the Coward , and did take it from him Titin . O Cassius , Brutus gaue the word too early , Who hauing some aduantage on Octauius , Tooke it too eagerly : his Soldiers fell to spoyle , Whilst we by Antony are all inclos ' d . Enter Pindarus . Pind . Fly further off my Lord : flye further off , Mark Antony is in your Tents my Lord : Flye therefore Noble Cassius , flye farre off Cassi . This Hill is farre enough . Looke , look Titinius Are those my Tents where I perceiue the fire ? Tit . They are , my Lord Cassi . Titinius , if thou louest me , Mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurres in him , Till he haue brought thee vp to yonder Troopes And heere againe , that I may rest assur ' d Whether yond Troopes , are Friend or Enemy Tit . I will be heere againe , euen with a thought . Enter . Cassi . Go Pindarus , get higher on that hill , My sight was euer thicke : regard Titinius , And tell me what thou not ' st about the Field . This day I breathed first , Time is come round , And where I did begin , there shall I end , My life is run his compasse . Sirra , what newes ? Pind . Aboue . O my Lord Cassi . What newes ? Pind . Titinius is enclosed round about With Horsemen , that make to him on the Spurre , Yet he spurres on . Now they are almost on him : Now Titinius . Now some light : O he lights too . Hee ' s tane . Showt . And hearke , they shout for ioy Cassi . Come downe , behold no more : O Coward that I am , to liue so long , To see my best Friend tane before my face Enter Pindarus . Come hither sirrah : In Parthia did I take thee Prisoner , And then I swore thee , sauing of thy life , That whatsoeuer I did bid thee do , Thou should ' st attempt it . Come now , keepe thine oath , Now be a Free - man , and with this good Sword That ran through Caesars bowels , search this bosome . Stand not to answer : Heere , take thou the Hilts , And when my face is couer ' d , as ' tis now , Guide thou the Sword - Caesar , thou art reueng ' d , Euen with the Sword that kill ' d thee Pin . So , I am free , Yet would not so haue beene Durst I haue done my will . O Cassius , Farre from this Country Pindarus shall run , Where neuer Roman shall take note of him . Enter Titinius and Messala . Messa . It is but change , Titinius : for Octauius Is ouerthrowne by Noble Brutus power , As Cassius Legions are by Antony Titin . These tydings will well comfort Cassius Messa . Where did you leaue him Titin . All disconsolate , With Pindarus his Bondman , on this Hill Messa . Is not that he that lyes vpon the ground ? Titin . He lies not like the Liuing . O my heart ! Messa . Is not that hee ? Titin . No , this was he Messala , But Cassius is no more . O setting Sunne : As in thy red Rayes thou doest sinke to night ; So in his red blood Cassius day is set . The Sunne of Rome is set . Our day is gone , Clowds , Dewes , and Dangers come ; our deeds are done : Mistrust of my successe hath done this deed Messa . Mistrust of good successe hath done this deed . O hatefull Error , Melancholies Childe : Why do ' st thou shew to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not ? O Error soone conceyu ' d , Thou neuer com ' st vnto a happy byrth , But kil ' st the Mother that engendred thee Tit . What Pindarus ? Where art thou Pindarus ? Messa . Seeke him Titinius , whilst I go to meet The Noble Brutus , thrusting this report Into his eares ; I may say thrusting it : For piercing Steele , and Darts inuenomed , Shall be as welcome to the eares of Brutus , As tydings of this sight Tit . Hye you Messala , And I will seeke for Pindarus the while : Why did ' st thou send me forth braue Cassius ? Did I not meet thy Friends , and did not they Put on my Browes this wreath of Victorie , And bid me giue it thee ? Did ' st thou not heare their showts ? Alas , thou hast misconstrued euery thing . But hold thee , take this Garland on thy Brow , Thy Brutus bid me giue it thee , and I Will do his bidding . Brutus , come apace , And see how I regarded Caius Cassius : By your leaue Gods : This is a Romans part , Come Cassius Sword , and finde Titinius hart . Dies Alarum . Enter Brutus , Messala , yong Cato , Strato , Volumnius , and Lucillius . Bru . Where , where Messala , doth his body lye ? Messa . Loe yonder , and Titinius mourning it Bru . Titinius face is vpward Cato . He is slaine Bru . O Iulius Caesar , thou art mighty yet , Thy Spirit walkes abroad , and turnes our Swords In our owne proper Entrailes . Low Alarums Cato . Braue Titinius , Looke where he haue not crown ' d dead Cassius Bru . Are yet two Romans liuing such as these ? The last of all the Romans , far thee well : It is impossible , that euer Rome Should breed thy fellow . Friends I owe mo teares To this dead man , then you shall see me pay . I shall finde time , Cassius : I shall finde time . Come therefore , and to Tharsus send his body , His Funerals shall not be in our Campe , Least it discomfort vs . Lucillius come , And come yong Cato , let vs to the Field , Labio and Flauio set our Battailes on : ' Tis three a clocke , and Romans yet ere night , We shall try Fortune in a second fight . Exeunt . Alarum . Enter Brutus , Messala , Cato , Lucillius , and Flauius . Bru . Yet Country - men : O yet , hold vp your heads Cato . What Bastard doth not ? Who will go with me ? I will proclaime my name about the Field . I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato , hoe . A Foe to Tyrants , and my Countries Friend . I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato , hoe . Enter Souldiers , and fight . And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus , I , Brutus my Countries Friend : Know me for Brutus Luc . O yong and Noble Cato , art thou downe ? Why now thou dyest , as brauely as Titinius , And may ' st be honour ' d , being Cato ' s Sonne Sold . Yeeld , or thou dyest Luc . Onely I yeeld to dye : There is so much , that thou wilt kill me straight : Kill Brutus , and be honour ' d in his death Sold . We must not : a Noble Prisoner . Enter Antony . 2 . Sold . Roome hoe : tell Antony , Brutus is tane 1 . Sold . Ile tell thee newes . Heere comes the Generall , Brutus is tane , Brutus is tane my Lord Ant . Where is hee ? Luc . Safe Antony , Brutus is safe enough : I dare assure thee , that no Enemy Shall euer take aliue the Noble Brutus : The Gods defend him from so great a shame , When you do finde him , or aliue , or dead , He will be found like Brutus , like himselfe Ant . This is not Brutus friend , but I assure you , A prize no lesse in worth ; keepe this man safe , Giue him all kindnesse . I had rather haue Such men my Friends , then Enemies . Go on , And see where Brutus be aliue or dead , And bring vs word , vnto Octauius Tent : How euery thing is chanc ' d . Exeunt . Enter Brutus , Dardanius , Clitus , Strato , and Volumnius . Brut . Come poore remaines of friends , rest on this Rocke Clit . Statillius shew ' d the Torch - light , but my Lord He came not backe : he is or tane , or slaine Brut . Sit thee downe , Clitus : slaying is the word , It is a deed in fashion . Hearke thee , Clitus Clit . What I , my Lord ? No , not for all the World Brut . Peace then , no words Clit . Ile rather kill my selfe Brut . Hearke thee , Dardanius Dard . Shall I doe such a deed ? Clit . O Dardanius Dard . O Clitus Clit . What ill request did Brutus make to thee ? Dard . To kill him , Clitus : looke he meditates Clit . Now is that Noble Vessell full of griefe , That it runnes ouer euen at his eyes Brut . Come hither , good Volumnius , list a word Volum . What sayes my Lord ? Brut . Why this , Volumnius : The Ghost of Caesar hath appear ' d to me Two seuerall times by Night : at Sardis , once ; And this last Night , here in Philippi fields : I know my houre is come Volum . Not so , my Lord Brut . Nay , I am sure it is , Volumnius . Thou seest the World , Volumnius , how it goes , Our Enemies haue beat vs to the Pit : Low Alarums . It is more worthy , to leape in our selues , Then tarry till they push vs . Good Volumnius , Thou know ' st , that we two went to Schoole together : Euen for that our loue of old , I prethee Hold thou my Sword Hilts , whilest I runne on it Vol . That ' s not an Office for a friend , my Lord . Alarum still . Cly . Fly , flye my Lord , there is no tarrying heere Bru . Farewell to you , and you , and Volumnius . Strato , thou hast bin all this while asleepe : Farewell to thee , to Strato , Countrymen : My heart doth ioy , that yet in all my life , I found no man , but he was true to me . I shall haue glory by this loosing day More then Octauius , and Marke Antony , By this vile Conquest shall attaine vnto . So fare you well at once , for Brutus tongue Hath almost ended his liues History : Night hangs vpon mine eyes , my Bones would rest , That haue but labour ' d , to attaine this houre . Alarum . Cry within , Flye , flye , flye . Cly . Fly my Lord , flye Bru . Hence : I will follow : I prythee Strato , stay thou by thy Lord , Thou art a Fellow of a good respect : Thy life hath had some smatch of Honor in it , Hold then my Sword , and turne away thy face , While I do run vpon it . Wilt thou Strato ? Stra . Giue me your hand first . Fare you wel my Lord Bru . Farewell good Strato . - Caesar , now be still , I kill ' d not thee with halfe so good a will . Dyes . Alarum . Retreat . Enter Antony , Octauius , Messala , Lucillius , and the Army . Octa . What man is that ? Messa . My Masters man . Strato , where is thy Master ? Stra . Free from the Bondage you are in Messala , The Conquerors can but make a fire of him : For Brutus onely ouercame himselfe , And no man else hath Honor by his death Lucil . So Brutus should be found . I thank thee Brutus That thou hast prou ' d Lucillius saying true , Octa . All that seru ' d Brutus , I will entertaine them . Fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ? Stra . I , if Messala will preferre me to you Octa . Do so , good Messala Messa . How dyed my Master Strato ? Stra . I held the Sword , and he did run on it Messa . Octauius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest seruice to my Master Ant . This was the Noblest Roman of them all : All the Conspirators saue onely hee , Did that they did , in enuy of great Caesar : He , onely in a generall honest thought , And common good to all , made one of them . His life was gentle , and the Elements So mixt in him , that Nature might stand vp , And say to all the world ; This was a man Octa . According to his Vertue , let vs vse him Withall Respect , and Rites of Buriall . Within my Tent his bones to night shall ly , Most like a Souldier ordered Honourably : So call the Field to rest , and let ' s away , To part the glories of this happy day . Exeunt . omnes . FINIS .
